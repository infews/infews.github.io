_From the "Can you pronounce my name" game/meme from Twitter early fall, 2020. I love this one._ &mdash;dwf 

__Davis:__ 10/10 All day

__David (if _your_ name is David):__  9/10 You’ll get it

__David (1st time):__ 5/10 Likely a typo

__David (>2nd time):__ 2/10

__Frank:__ 0/10 There is no comma in my name

__Dave:__ 6/10 But it’s never stuck

__D:__  2/10 Do I know you?

__DWF (rhymes with “woof”):__ 12/10 💪 I have cooked for you
