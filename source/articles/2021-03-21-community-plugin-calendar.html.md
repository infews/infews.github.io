This plug-in works with the Daily Notes plug-in. It adds a new tab in the right pane that gives a single-month view. Each date links to that day's daily note, with a cute dot notation for the length of that note. You can also browse back and forth between months.

I find this is faster for zeroing in on historical notes. And sometimes you just need another calendar right in front of you during the day.
