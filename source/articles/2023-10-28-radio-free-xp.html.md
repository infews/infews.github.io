For your weekend podcast listening pleasure - I was the guest on Radio Free XP this week[^1].

I got to talk to Tony and Jesse about my Pairing Journey. There is probably the most resonance with folks who worked at or with Pivotal/Labs, but I got to tell some fun stories. We talked about parallels between pairing and collaborative gaming - including a shout-out to the classic [Infocom][i] text adventures and the more recent [Overcooked][oc] - and pairing stories from the real world that worked and didn't. Then we wind up by talking to our former coworkers who are impacted by the Broadcom/VMware acquisition.

[Share and enjoy!][pod]
