When I was a big [nvALT][nva] user, I got very used to a specific set of actions whenever I needed to take notes on something I would...

1. `Cmd-Tab` over to nvALT
1. `Cmd-L` to get to the search bar
1. Type the thing on my mind
1. Scan the search results
1. Choose a note Edit/Append to the note as needed

or

5. Hit `Enter` to make a new file to empty my brain into

This was deep, _deep_ muscle memory for me. "This feels familiar. Did I ever write anything up about..." then `Cmd-Tab`, `Cmd-L`, type-ity-type-ity, and continue on. This was very smooth.

As much as I've raved about Obsidian in this series, I was missing this feature.

But it turns out that `Cmd-O` is _all you had to say_. It's nearly the same functionality. The search happens in a modal dialog and gives you the option of navigating down to the note you want or just creating a new note with the search contents as the title.

And yes, Windows & Linux users, `Ctrl-O`.

I now keep my left pane collapsed by default and only use the search tab for looking for tags.

Just glorious.
