I was "off" last week as I was at [RailsConf 2024][rc24] in Detroit with several hundred other Rubyists on Rails. It was a fun and interesting time. I thought the program committee did an exceptional job this year with the technical topics and inspirational keynotes. Having a day that was _just_ workshops and OSS project hacking was genius. I hope to see this continue at RubyConf and other conferences in the future.

Attendees have been posting their reflections all week - check ruby.social - and the talks should be up in a month or so. I'll be linking to my favorites then.

Great job, team! And thanks!

## Codex Updates and Highlights

Not much new added to the [Pivotal Alumni Codex][codex] in the past couple of weeks. Instead, here's a highlight!

This week I'm going to point to the [Labs Practices][lp] site, and directory of open-sourced-resources that Pivotal Labs, and VMware Tanzu Labs gathered over the years for our clients. This is worth bookmarking for facilitation guides, technique descriptions, and learning paths.

## In The Wild

[How Slack Automates Deploys][slack] H/T to Josh Aresty for pointing me at this. It's a good story about how Slack went from a very manual to a very automated deploy system. This felt very familiar to my recent work, yet I've got a few new techniques to try when advising a release team again.

[BackgroundMusic for MacOS][bg] A new-to-me, free homebrew-installable, audio utility. Best reason to install it: the virtual microphone that means you can use ScreenRecorder to get system audio in your video. Best reasons to keep it: independent, relative volume controls for open apps and auto-muting of music when you move to a video call.

[20 Things I've Learned as a Systems (Over) Thinker][cutler] by John Cutler. Another winner from John. As I said when I re-shared this on LinkedIn - "It me."

[A Radical Enterprise Quick Start Guide for Business Leaders][guide] A good jumping off point before you dive into [Matt Parker][mp]'s book [A Radical Enterprise][mp-book]. Which reminds me a bit of...

[Doing Agile Right][dar] by  [Darrell Rigby](https://www.amazon.com/Darrell-Rigby/e/B0025BULBU/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1), [Sarah Elk](https://www.amazon.com/Sarah-Elk/e/B083RYLPXB/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_2) , and  [Steve Berez](https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Berez/e/B083P2WPQN/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_3). When this book came out, I attended a Q&A with one of the authors and was prepared to be constructively confrontational. My experience with management consultants and "Agile Transformations" was...not great. But what I learned from Sarah's answers, and this book - much like Matt Parker's book above - is that the Agile Software Manifesto has reflections _everywhere_. And it's a systems-thinking mindset, a desire to shrink feedback loops, and reminder that you're working with _people_ that can help _any_ project move faster with less waste.

[Better Together!][bt]  [Jason Fraser][jf] posted about [Move Fast][mf] and how it's a solid companion to his and Janice Fraser's book [Farther Faster]. I'm adding Move Fast to my queue.

Let me know if you're enjoying these. Feedback is much appreciated. My social links are above.
