## Codex Updates

A couple of updates on the [Agility Resources/Practices page][practices]:

I can confirm that Broadcom dropping their Miro subscription has not affected the Tanzu/Pivotal Labs contributions to the Miroverse. This solid set of great starter boards for various sessions live here happily.

New to me is the the Tanzu [Library][lib] board: a list of recommended books, with category tags, and room for short reviews. This would be great for a team's book club.

Also, Ben Christel has added his _Automated Project Management_ presentation, which shares how he talks about and uses Pivotal Tracker.

## In The Wild

[Planet Money][planet] has [a podcast episode][hack] about Open Source software, told with the framing story of the [XZ hack][xz] from earlier this year.

I expect it will be a good primer on OSS for anyone you know who's _not_ in the software business.

And if you're sending this podcast to one of those folks, here's the referenced [XKCD "Jenga" comic][xkcd], titled, appropriately, _Dependency_. Don't miss the hover!
