Way back in 2013 I got a last minute request from [Sarah Mei][sm] for a 10 minute talk during the Golden Gate Ruby Conference's "Story time." IIRC, it was meant to be a "break time" talk. Something light and fun so that the attendee's brains could catch up a bit between deep technical sessions.

I knew exactly which stories I wanted to pull together. And it was a lot of fun to give.

I had mostly forgotten about this talk and totally forgotten that it was recorded. So imagine my surprise when I 
uncovered the video this week. And that it had 200+ views!

If you're curious, or you were there and want the 10-year flashback, or maybe just want a ten-minute break today, 
here it is. I hope you enjoy it.
