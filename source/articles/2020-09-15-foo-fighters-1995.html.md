_A tweetstorm I wrote up from being at a very early Foo Fighters' show. I've kept this in Tweet format because I wrote it in 280-word segments.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">But an absolutely AMAZING mosh pit. Near the end of the show, the band took a short breather to change guitars or something. And we all stood there, spent.<br><br>Then they started “Exhausted.” But nobody was dancing.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was in the middle of the room at the edge of a big circle of people. I wanted to keep the excitement. After a 30 seconds or so, when the song is still slow, I tucked in my arms and started rolling slowly to the tempo off of everyone along the inside of the circle. 3/7</p>&mdash; Thank You for being a VOTER (@dwfrank) <a href="https://twitter.com/dwfrank/status/1305724885503602689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just me became two or three, then four people. Not crazy dancing, but just building. And building. Just like the song. By the crescendo we had the pit at full strength. That song felt like it went on forever. Just forever. It was so special. 4/7</p>&mdash; Thank You for being a VOTER (@dwfrank) <a href="https://twitter.com/dwfrank/status/1305724886187302915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2020</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fast forward about 4 months. The tour is wrapping up. And I’m listening to a Westwood One interview with the band on a Sunday night. They start taking calls from the audience. “What was your favorite show during this tour?” 5/7</p>&mdash; Thank You for being a VOTER (@dwfrank) <a href="https://twitter.com/dwfrank/status/1305724886896144384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2020</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dave Grohl- “It’s just so great to be on tour. That we’ve picked up fans and they’ve embraced us.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Then one of the other band members jumps in. “You member that one night in Portland? When they started MOSHING? To f’n EXHAUSTED? That never happens.” Dave - “Oh, yeah. By the end that was NUTS. What a show!”<br>🎸🕺🤘 <br>7/7</p>&mdash; Thank You for being a VOTER (@dwfrank) <a href="https://twitter.com/dwfrank/status/1305724888284504064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2020</a></blockquote>
