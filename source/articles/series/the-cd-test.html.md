After twelve years working at Pivotal Software &mdash; first as a consultant, then in management &mdash; I have observed dozens of projects. I have seen test frameworks come and go. I have seen all manner of Agile dogma ebb and flow. Pivotal's process is was firmly rooted in <a href="http://extremeprogramming.org" data-proofer-ignore>Extreme Programming</a>, but like any good process it adapted. We incorporated concepts from [Balanced Team][bt] and [Lean Startup][ls]. "XP" and "Agile" have become loaded terms, so I've switched to using the term "Continuous Delivery," or just "CD."

I often get asked the question, "How can I introduce CD to my team?" There are as many ways to make the journey as there are teams. I wrote the following blog post to give you and your team a guide. It's a way to measure your process now. And can used as a "to do" list for how to proceed.

First up, a test.
