[vaults]: /series/obsidian/thoughts-on-vaults

Obsidian's URL scheme is fabulous. A link of this form:

`obsidian://open?vault=<vault_name>&file=<note_name>`

..will open Obsidian with that vault and that note selected.

I use this a lot with my task manager, linking back from projects and tasks to longer thoughts on the topic. I also link to notes [other vaults][vaults] as needed.

With any note open, "Copy Obsidian URL" is available via the Command Palette and the note menu.
