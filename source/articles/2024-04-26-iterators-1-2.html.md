Welcome to week 2!

**[The Pivotal Alumni Codex][codex]** Pivotal (former) employees have had a free Alumni Slack for several years now. Free Slack instances have a two key problems. First is the 90-day history which is makes the second problem, a middling search capability, even worse. We've solved that with the Alumni Codex, a collection of Pivotal History, tools, and techniques. This is a public website and if you're part of the Iterators community, have a look. Note - we do take pull requests.

**[Radio Free XP][rfxp]** This podcast, hosted by Pivots Tony Hansmann and Jesse T. Alford, is a set of interviews mostly about pair programming and Pivotal history. Add this to your favorite podcast app and get listening.

**[You Probably Don't Need Media Queries Anymore][mq]** I started with the question of "What are the Media Queries I should be using to target different phone sizes?" and got this recommendation (from the Pivotal Alumni Slack). There are some great tips here about some CSS features I hadn't kept up with: new units (`fr`, `vh`, and `vw`), interesting _functions_ (`calc()` and `clamp()`) , and a mindset that we can think of things more continuously instead of with constantly shifting size breakpoints. I solved three problems in about an hour with these insights. Though I'm not convinced about `display: grid` just yet. I'm still very much #teamflexbox.

**[NASA's Voyager 1 Resumes Sending Engineering Updates to Earth][vger]** This news was all around this week. But this official telling at NASA hints at what must've been some very impressive code reorganization and refactoring in order to use _what's still working_ on that craft. Forget the immense latency and feedback loops for a moment and think about moving 50-year-old+ machine code to _memory_ that's working. Mind blowing, but essential work to ensure we get to V'ger.

**[SQLite on Rails: The how and why of optimal performance][sqlite]** The performance improvements keep coming to Ruby and Rails. Come for the textbook discussion of a performance problem, along with data and graphs. Leave with a one-liner to improve the number of continuous connections your Rails-app-using-SQLite can have to its database.

## Subscribing?

I got some feedback this week along the lines of "if I can't subscribe to this 'newsletter' how am I supposed to read it?" If this takes off, I will look into making this email subscribe-able.  But until then, RSS is your best bet. Here is a list of readers that folks are using (RIP Google Reader):

- [FreshRSS](https://www.freshrss.org/)
- [Readwise](https://readwise.io/read)
- [Feedly](https://feedly.com/)

Thanks! Feedback welcome

Phew, that's two! Feedback welcome (see [my about page](/about_me))!
