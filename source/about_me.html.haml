%p
  You may know me from my time at Pivotal and Pivotal Labs, where I helped our clients build Ruby on Rails or mobile JavaScript apps. Or maybe from co-writing
  = link_to "Jasmine","https://jasmine.github.io"
  , a JavaScript testing framework. Or maybe you saw me speak at RailsConf. Or some local meetup.

%p It's good to see you again!

%p I can talk and write endlessly about Ruby, JavaScript, Web Applications, Test-Driven Development, and Agile Software Methodologies. I can also talk about bourbon, barbecue, or just tell you a fun story.
