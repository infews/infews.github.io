%p I am an experienced software engineering leader with a demonstrated history helping software teams shorten feedback loops, ship software, and stay happy.

%h2 Technology Skills

%dl
  %dt Test-driven Development
  %dd I write tests first so that design, implementation, refactoring, and bug fixing are easier. I enjoy encouraging teams to do the same because it makes teams, business owners, and customers happy.

  %dt Pair Programming
  %dd I can pair on code with another developer. It is fun, fast, and encourages information sharing. I also like coaching others to be better pairs. And that helps teams get smoother and faster.

  %dt Ruby
  %dd I returned to coding after a few years by learning Ruby. Its syntax and style brought me right back to the software engineering mindset. Ruby makes me happy to code.

  %dt JavaScript
  %dd
    I was part of the movement to treat JavaScript as a first class language. This lead to co-authoring
    = succeed "," do
      = link_to "Jasmine", "https://jasmine.github.io"
    so that we could test drive our code, consulting on applications for Palm's webOS, and several single-page web apps. I still like the idea of passing functions as parameters and can asynchronicity most of the time with keep up.

  %dt Web Application & SaaS Development
  %dd As both consultant, tech lead, and manager, I have developed dozens of applications, APIs, and other services for the web. While this is primarily with Ruby on Rails, I have also managed teams using Go, BASH, C/C++, Java/Spring, and Kotlin/Spring.

  %dt Cloud Infrastructure
  %dd
    I have worked with PaaS solutions from Engine Yard, Cloud Foundry, and Heroku. I have worked with Cloud Provider products and APIs from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. I also know a bit about Kubernetes and
    = succeed "." do
      = link_to "BOSH", "https://bosh.io/docs/"

  %dt Continuous Delivery & Iterative Development
  %dd
    I have coached and managed projects on how to build sustainable momentum using techniques from the
    = link_to "Continuous Delivery", "https://dwf.bigpencil.net/series/the-cd-test/"
    toolbox. In addition to the skills listed above, I have introduced Weekly Planning, Continuous Integration, and Retrospectives, among other techniques.

  %dt Continuous Integration & Release Engineering
  %dd
    I have set up CI systems for web and mobile projects using cloud services like
    = link_to "TravisCI", "https://www.travis-ci.com/"
    and
    = succeed "," do
      = link_to "CircleCI", "https://circleci.com/"
    and deployed self-managed systems like
    = link_to "Jenkins", "https://www.jenkins.io/"
    and
    = succeed "." do
      = link_to "Concourse", "https://concourse-ci.org/"
    I have used CI to implement Release Engineering tasks like packaging, variable configuration, and scenario testing. CI is a team's best friend.

  %dt Bottleneck Analysis & Remediation
  %dd I love making code and teams run more smoothly. This can mean instrumenting an application to figure out why code is slow. It can mean pointing out to teams that they can do something a different way. I find that fixing these problems is very satisfying. And it makes people happy.

  %dt Mobile Development Constraints
  %dd I have run teams building for PalmOS, webOS, Android, and iOS. I have taught teams how to adjust their expectations for higher latency networks, limited data bandwidth, and different user interaction expectations.

  %dt Legacy Technology Skills
  %dd I spent my early career working with digital desktop video and graphics on Microsoft Windows. I wrote low-level assembly routines, worked around sub-systems, and helped make Windows a viable video and game platform.

%h2 Organization & Human Skills

%dl

  %dt Mentoring
  %dd I can share my experience, both personal and professional, to coach others on how to navigate challenges. I have used these skills to help VP's rewrite job descriptions to be more effective and help college students get internships.

  %dt Team Building
  %dd I have built teams from scratch. I have inherited teams and improved them. I have moved work ownership from one team to another without missing a release.

  %dt Stakeholder Management
  %dd I have built trust with internal customers and clients across industries. I have helped them manage budgets from five to seven figures. I have set their expectations and managed teams to meet them.

  %dt Facilitation
  %dd I can lead a discussion to break down a problem, iterate on solutions, and drive shared understanding. I have used these skills in group mentoring sessions, sales meetings, and project kickoffs.

  %dt Communication
  %dd I am a storyteller. I can give presentations to an audience of 300, a meetup of a couple of dozen, or even just one-on-one. Writing a blog post or a presentation is one of my favorite ways to solidify my understanding of a topic. It's even better when I can get a laugh.
