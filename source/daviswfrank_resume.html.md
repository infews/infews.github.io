## Management Skills

Facilitation
: I can lead a discussion to break down a problem, iterate on solutions, and drive shared understanding. I have used these skills in group mentoring sessions, sales meetings, regular retrospectives, and project kickoffs.

Communication
: I am a storyteller. I can give presentations to an audience of 300, a meetup of a couple of dozen, or even just one-on-one. Writing a blog post or a presentation is one of my favorite ways to solidify my understanding of a topic. It's even better when I can get a laugh.

People Management
: After nearly twenty years of managing people - individuals and managers - I have found that the most important skill is providing empathetic feedback. I have built feedback systems and coached people to improve their feedback-giving and -receiving skills.

Mentoring
: I can coach others by sharing my personal and professional experience as they navigate challenges. I have helped college students pitch themselves for summer internships, mentored managers to become directors, and co-rewrote job descriptions with Vice Presidents.

Team Building
: I have established, inherited, and improved teams. I have moved code ownership from one team to another without missing a release.

Leading Distributed Teams
: It's great when a team is co-located. But as responsibilities scale, I have added, grown, and managed remote teams while keeping them working well together.

Stakeholder Management
: I have built trust with internal customers and clients across industries. I have helped them manage budgets from five to seven figures. I have set their expectations and managed teams to meet and exceed them.

## Technology Skills

Test-driven Development
: I write tests first so that design, implementation, refactoring, and bug fixing are faster and less expensive. I enjoy encouraging teams to do the same because it makes teams, business owners, and customers happy.

Pair Programming
: I can code with another developer. It is fun, fast, and encourages information sharing. I also like coaching others to be better pairs. That helps teams get more productive and reduces product risk across the board.

Ruby
: I picked up Ruby after a few years away from coding. Ruby is just so much fun to write and maintain. I've worked on several small Ruby projects and a few dozen Ruby on Rails applications, from version 1.2 up to Rails 6.

JavaScript
: I was part of the movement to treat JavaScript as a first class language and apart from web browsers. This led to co-authoring and co-managing the open source project [Jasmine][jasmine], so that we could test drive our JS, consulting on applications for Palm's webOS, and working on several single-page web apps. Jasmine then became one of the most popular TDD/BDD frameworks for JavaScript. I still like the idea of passing functions as parameters and can asynchronicity most of the time with keep up.

Web Application & SaaS Development
: As a consultant, tech lead, and manager, I have developed dozens of applications, APIs, and other services for the web. Most used Ruby on Rails, and thus JavaScript, HTML and CSS are very familiar. I have also managed web-dev teams using Java/Spring, Kotlin/Spring, and Node.js.

Cloud Infrastructure
: I have deployed web applications to PaaS solutions from [Engine Yard][ey], [Cloud Foundry][cf], and [Heroku][h]. I have worked with Cloud Provider products and APIs from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. I have also worked with Kubernetes and [BOSH][bosh].

Continuous Delivery & Iterative Development
: I have coached and managed teams on how to build sustainable momentum using techniques from the [Continuous Delivery][cd-test] toolbox. I have introduced Weekly Iteration Planning, Continuous Integration, and Retrospectives, among other patterns.

Continuous Integration & Release Engineering
: I have set up CI systems for web and mobile projects using cloud services like [TravisCI][travis] and [CircleCI][circle], and deployed self-managed systems of [Jenkins][j] and [Concourse][cc]. I have used CI to implement Release Engineering tasks like packaging, product configuration, and scenario testing. CI is a team's best automated friend.

Bottleneck Analysis & Remediation
: I love making code and teams run more smoothly. This can mean instrumenting an application to figure out why code is slow. It can mean working with teams to help find more effective solutions.

Data Engineering
: I have helped a team take a mess of scheduled queries and work them into a scalable, tested, set of data pipelines. This turned an interrupt-driven team into a more predictable, product-outcome-driven one.

Mobile Development Constraints
: I have run teams building for PalmOS, webOS, Android, and iOS. I have taught teams how to adjust their expectations for higher latency networks, limited data bandwidth, and different user interaction expectations.

Legacy Technology Skills
: I spent my early career working with digital desktop video and graphics on Microsoft Windows. I wrote low-level assembly routines, C/C++ application and driver code, spelunked in graphics sub-systems, and helped make Windows a viable video and game platform.

As a member of the leadership team reporting to our VP of Engineering, we restaffed a team from Ireland to the US, dealt with regular joint-venture management issues, and managed our team through an acquisition. I continued to run the summer intern roundtable, incorporating the Palo Alto interns from the PKS and [Greenplum][gp] teams.

I was an engineer on the Open Source CF Cloud API team and managed 4 engineers on other teams. I facilitated working sessions to improve managers' skills across the San Francisco office. I rebuilt the summer intern experience, starting a weekly "intern roundtable," where Pivotal leaders from around the company came for an AMA-style chat with our developer, product manager, and designer interns.

#### Senior Software Engineer

I led the development team for <i>Divine Caroline</i>, a web-only women’s interest magazine. This was custom CMS built in Rails. As a startup, they intended to sell the platform for online magazines. The writing and editing staff was our real-world, yet internal customers.

_Learned that every startup is different, that sometimes indirect management of people is more impactful than direct, and that surrounding yourself with people in diverse roles makes for a much more fulfilling day._

### Personal Sabbatical <span class="duration">2006 June - 2007 February </span>
