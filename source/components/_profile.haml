  You may know me from my time at Pivotal and Pivotal Labs, where I helped our clients build Ruby on Rails or mobile JavaScript apps. Or maybe from co-writing [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io), a JavaScript testing framework. Or maybe you saw me speak at RailsConf. Or some local meetup.

  It's good to see you again!

  I can talk and write endlessly about Ruby, JavaScript, Web Applications, Test-Driven Development, and Agile Software Methodologies. I can also talk about bourbon, barbecue, or just tell you a fun story. Read more below.
