After twelve years working at Pivotal Software &mdash; first as a consultant, then in management &mdash; I have observed dozens of projects. I have seen test frameworks come and go. I have seen all manner of Agile dogma ebb and flow. Pivotal's process is was firmly rooted in [Extreme Programming][xp], but like any good process it adapted. We incorporated concepts from [Balanced Team][bt] and [Lean Startup][ls].
