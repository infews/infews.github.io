There is probably the most resonance with folks who worked at or with Pivotal/Labs, but I got to tell some fun stories. We talked about parallels between pairing and collaborative gaming - including a shout-out to the classic Infocom text adventures and the more recent Overcooked - and pairing stories from the real world that worked and didn’t. Then we wind up by talking to our former coworkers who are impacted by the Broadcom/VMware acquisition.\n\nShare and enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Recorded on 2023-10-25 \u0026#8617;\n    \n  \n\n","@context":"https://schema.org"}
