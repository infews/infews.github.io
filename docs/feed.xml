    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The spice must flow…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Slootman’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/amp-up-frank-slootman/"&gt;Amp It Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; advocates removing “slack” (the concept, not the app) from a team to get greatest productivity. There’s pushback that this approach is toxic and/or it leads to colossal burnout. I agree. Low slack is not the same as high productivity. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fnthawar/"&gt;Farhan Thawar&lt;/a&gt; shared &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fnthawar/status/1314902602509938688"&gt;a list of characteristics or practices&lt;/a&gt; that lead to productive teams. I like this list a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like his list no doubt because Farhan and I both used to work at Pivotal Labs. But I’d like to take a different approach to talking about software team productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of focusing on removing slack from a team, the best way to make a team productive is &lt;a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/"&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;/a&gt;. That is, setting the team up such that new work is flowing from concept to development to production smoothly and often. There is continuous delivery of value to customers. When work ships, it works as expected, it’s reliable, and there is little re-work. The team, by default, is always looking forward to the next new value they can be delivering. There is a low amount of waste during development. When there is waste, the team adapts to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Continuous Delivery team looks much like a modern physical goods manufacturing line. From the outside it looks like requirements go in and work - features and fixes - come of out the other side. Inside there are conscientious workers, well-maintained machines, and low inventory. People are improving their workflows for higher efficiency. When there are problems, Andon cords get pulled, and the team stops to fix them. A high functioning CD team has high productivity with low stress. And they are improving themselves all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How close is your team to this ideal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joel Spolksy gave us the &lt;a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/"&gt;Joel Test&lt;/a&gt; for evaluating software teams 20 years ago. It is still relevant, but this test is of a time of shrink-wrapped, desktop software. Bug databases and source control have become defaults. Most software is web-deployed applications and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With apologies to and inspiration from Joel, I give you &lt;em&gt;The CD Test&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; a list of simple yes/no questions to check your team. The score is the sum of yes answers. A high score doesn’t mean your team is perfect at Continuous Delivery. But if you review your “no” answers I’m sure you’ll find discussion points for improving your team. Here goes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Continuous Delivery Test&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the team have a single product owner?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a single backlog of stories, stack ranked in priority order?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the team have weekly planning meetings to review the backlog?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are stories completed in a day or two?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do developers take the next story from the top of this backlog?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do developers test-drive their code?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the test suite fast enough that you don’t complain about them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a Continuous Integration system that runs on every commit?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does every CI green build get deployed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the Product Owner accept work by exercising it in the product and with low latency?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it simple and “low drama” to make a production deployment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do features make it to production frequently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the team have daily stand-ups, with a goal of communicating change and unblocking issues?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do people work on one project at a time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it easy for developers to move between teams?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are teams composed of team members of diverse skill levels?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is asking for help, thus leading to knowledge acquisition, seen as a strength?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Quality an exploratory function (and not a gatekeeper to release)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the team meet weekly for Retrospectives to discuss team issues, leading to new work that improves team progress?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the team complete their action items from Retrospectives?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does the team have a single product owner?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody has to be The Decider. For CD teams, this is the Product Owner (or Product Manager). Everyone from customer support to leadership should be making their requests for new work. But the Product Owner needs to be the  Decider. The Product Owner takes all this input and prioritizes it in the backlog. There will always be give and take on work priority - that is healthy. Often this means deciding what &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; get done. Too many cooks spoil the broth and too many stakeholders distracts a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is there a single backlog of stories, stack ranked in priority order?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If work definition lives across many pieces of software and many people’s brains, how does the team know what they should be working on? Once the Product Owner decides and prioritizes work, and the development team estimates it, this needs to be communicated. There should be a single, team-visible, stack-ranked backlog of work to do. Each piece of work - ok, I’ll call them stories. Each &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; should have enough information so that work can start. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each story should include use cases, acceptance criteria, estimates, design artifacts, and implementation ideas.  The key is to put it all in one place with clear priority order. This makes it easy for the team to pick up the next work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does the team have weekly planning meetings to review the backlog?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world around your product is changing all the time. The Product Owner needs to share these changes and how they affect the upcoming work. The rest of the team needs to digest and contribute their views to team understanding. The team needs to review designs and estimate implementation. This helps the team increase their shared understanding of the product. And it helps the Product Owner change priorities. Having this meeting weekly allows everyone to make small corrections and stay productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Are stories completed in a day or two?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long stories take a lot of time to understand, design, and implement. They seem perpetually “almost done.” The work is not yet available to verify and not yet in front of users. Some of the team is working on them and nothing else. Nobody is happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping stories small enough to complete in a day or two is the antidote to this problem. The stories are often simpler, making them easier to complete. It is easier for the Product Owner to verify smaller pieces of work, thus confirming progress. The team will build a sense of progress and maintain it. And customers will get more value more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do developers take the next story from the top of the backlog?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a developer completes a story, how do they decide what work is next? If developers aren’t getting their work from the Product Owner, what are they working on? Any other source of work and there is a high risk that it’s not the next most important work to provide user value. And there is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; high risk that this other work could provide little value to the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the backlog is well prioritized and well understood, then the next piece of work is obvious. This keeps the team moving forward in a uniform way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do developers test-drive their code?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing tests for code has become common. Test code has become part of the product. Writing tests that run several times a day helps find bugs early where and when they are cheapest to fix. Joel was spot-on for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But writing tests first is even better. It helps the team write only the code they need to finish a story. This means less waste in the development process. It also increases test coverage because tests define which code gets written. It will be easier to find bugs later when refactoring or when dependent code changes. And in another nod to Joel, well written tests are &lt;em&gt;even better&lt;/em&gt; than product specs. They tell “you in the future” how the code actually works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is the test suite fast enough that you don’t complain about it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the test suite is too slow, then development will be slow. The team will tend to run it less often, lengthening the feedback loop when they add new code. Or even worse, if the test suite takes too long to run the information it provides will be less relevant. You want a test suite and you want to run it often. So keep it fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team can keep their test suites fast with several techniques. They can reduce over-testing (hitting the same code over and over again). They can write only enough tests to keep confidence in the product high. They can parallelize tests. They can use the best hardware. They can limit testing external dependencies (e.g., external API’s). And since test code is product code, developers can refactor it as needed to keep performance at peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is there a Continuous Integration system that runs on every commit?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even today “it works on my machine” is still a problem. There can be accidental inconsistencies between development systems and production environments.  Developers can be working on semi-conflicting changes without realizing it. The product can be working, with test suites passing on one developer&amp;rsquo;s machine. But that same work could fail shortly after check-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous Integration (CI) takes every code commit, integrates the changes, and runs the full test suite. A &amp;ldquo;green build&amp;rdquo; means there are no conflicts. This means work can continue. When there are errors, the developers can fix them right away, dropping new work to fix the build. CI keeps the team flowing, preventing some bugs from making it to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does every CI green build get deployed?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A green CI build tells that the team that the product currently works as expected. It should &amp;ldquo;ship&amp;rdquo; to a deployment immediately for review. A team which is deploying every green CI build is acting in the spirit of The Joel Test&amp;rsquo;s daily builds. Less complicated products might do this on a staging deployment. More complicated products may deploy to production, but with feature flags. This prevents users from using new work before validation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not matter where the green build deploys. Regular deployment shows that the team knows how to build regularly and repeatedly. They find issues early. &amp;ldquo;Early&amp;rdquo; means after the tests have passed, but before users can exercise it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does the Product Owner accept work by exercising it in the product and with low latency?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A test suite tells everyone the current status of the product. CI will catch integration problems, broken features, or bug regressions. But what about that status of new work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New work should only ship to production when the Product Manager approves it. A staging deployment that has the latest green build of the product enables them to review new work. This is the opportunity to tell developers, “Great work! Let’s get it in front of users,” or, “Oops. This doesn’t work as we discussed. Let’s try again.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Product Owner is reviewing work early and often, it keeps the feedback loops short. Ideally they are validating new work daily. Fixing bugs and problems can happen more quickly. Or, if the work is as desired, the Product Owner can plan for how to get this new work to production and to users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is it simple and “low drama” to make a production deployment?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting new work to users is one of the most important things a product team can do. It is often one of the most fragile processes: too flaky, too manual, and resulting in extra hours worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, teams should treat deployment like a feature of the product. The Product Owner puts deployment stories in the backlog. Development implements them. The product ships to staging and production often. Changes in deployment, like changes in infrastructure or a database upgrade, suggest new stories in the backlog. Deployment is then simple, reliable, automated, and predictable. Customers get their new features consistently. And the team can go home on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do features make it to production frequently (&amp;gt; 1x every 3 mo)? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipping work to customers is important. It should happen often. Completed work that is not yet in production is potential waste. Without feedback from users you don’t know if the work was valuable. Any time that features “sit on the shelf” is time that a competitor could be using to take your customers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as a feature, or set of features, is practical for users to exercise it should get deployed to production. CD teams aim for deploying to production about once a week. This keeps feedback loops short and tight, delivering value to customers sooner. It also makes it easier for your developers to make changes when there is a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some products this is hard or seemingly impossible. Teams should drive to the highest frequency possible for their situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does the team have daily stand-ups, with a goal of communicating change and unblocking issues?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standups have become popular. They can add a lot of value to keep the team up to date. But they can also devolve into long, meandering status reports. Team members zone out, get distracted, and start to complain at retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective standups aren’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; quick. They focus on new information. They review changes to the backlog or the business. They discuss important external items (e.g., interview schedules, upcoming vacations). And they stay short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standup is a vital opportunity to ask the entire team for help. Using the team’s collective knowledge is good way to unblock hard problems. Unblocking progress is an essential step for a productive day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do people work on one project at a time?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splitting a person across multiple projects is a distraction waiting to happen. Humans are poor at multi-tasking and at adjusting expectations based on task splitting. Letting team members work on many projects at once adds task-switching costs to a project. This is waste. It may speed one team up, but will slow down the others others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping people working on a single team at a time allows for focus. Focus leads to personal flow. Personal flow leads to team flow. And team flow leads to getting new business value to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is it easy for developers to move between teams?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company is only one team right now, this will not apply. But any larger organization often splits into many, smaller teams. Keeping these teams siloed from each other can slow a product down. Or worse, it can slow the entire company down. Information and expertise stays locked up, reducing organization flexibility. This will slow down all the teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing and encouraging team member rotation keeps the organization flexible. Information, knowledge, and techniques will propagate around the organization. When one team is behind, managers can reallocate people to catch them up. And all the while everyone will learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Are teams composed of team members of diverse skill levels?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show me a &amp;ldquo;10x Engineer&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;ll show you a single point of failure. What happens when that engineer feels burned out? Or if they have a new work opportunity or a life change? Or if they go on vacation? Single points of failure put entire businesses at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative is to have teams with diverse sets of experience levels. Have the senior people teach the junior people. That turns them into senior people. A team where everyone is learning all the time is a happy team. And happy, knowledgable people do great work. They mitigate risk. They also spot problems and fix them. They keep the product at high quality and shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is asking for help, thus leading to knowledge acquisition, seen as a strength?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not enough to put junior and senior people together on teams. If the junior people do not feel welcome and safe to ask questions, then they will never gain knowledge. This is a risk to your business and your team will work more slowly in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hire people who are good at acquiring knowledge. Put them on teams that will immerse them in knowledge and help them apply it. Give the &amp;ldquo;junior&amp;rdquo; folks the opportunity to try and fail. Celebrate asking questions. Encourage this behavior at all levels. These teams will grow and evolve over time into productive engines for your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is Quality an exploratory function (and not a gatekeeper to release)?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your team is waiting for a QA team to tell you the product is ready, you have already lost. Features and bug fixes alike will sit in the queue to production. Everyone will be waiting for some absolute level of confidence that can never come. Meanwhile, your customers are waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving the testing &amp;ldquo;left,&amp;rdquo; closer to your developers, makes it cheaper to find and fix bugs. A good test suite tells you all you need to know about the functionality of the product. The Product Owner should be able to use the product to decide that work is ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But what about bugs?&amp;rdquo; Instead of worrying about bugs, think about Exploratory QA. Have people who use the product and find behavior that the team did not expect or test for. Sometimes these are bugs where the product is broken. Sometimes these are new use cases the team missed. Learn more by reading Elisabeth Hendrickson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2HdUWrs"&gt;Explore It!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing this behavior is then new work for Product Manager to consider for the backlog. And like any story in the backlog, it starts with a test. And that test ensures a fix or feature that should never regress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does the team meet weekly for Retrospectives to discuss team issues, leading to new work that improves team progress?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems, issues, and inefficiencies occur naturally on all teams. Things that worked when the team was small start to fail as the team grows. Technology choices don&amp;rsquo;t pan out. Experiments in process change fail. And there are countless other scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some process, techniques, and behaviors are the opposite. They work very well, solving problems and making the team stronger. They should be recognized and further promoted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weekly &lt;a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/heartbeatretro/"&gt;retrospective&lt;/a&gt; helps a team identify both problems and successes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams should celebrate every win. This makes team members feel good about their work. It cements good patterns for potential reuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussing problems also has many good effects on the team. Everyone gets on the same page. It vents frustration and surfaces anxiety. They can discussion potential solutions, building consensus on which ones to attempt. And they can track action items to implement them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does the team complete their action items from Retrospectives?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to talk about problems at a retrospective. The team has to suggest and agree on solutions. Then they need to track action items for their implementation. This means having the action items be clear. And each must have an owner and a due date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team should review the open action items at the beginning of each retro. This serves as a reminder to the owners. They are helping the team fix a problem and making everyone more productive and happy. When an action item is complete, the team should celebrate!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published as a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwfrank/status/1297643495897706496"&gt;tweetstorm&lt;/a&gt;, I expanded this one a little to make it more blog-worthy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;dwf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cook a lot at our house. We see cooking as a life skill and family activity. Being at home full time means we have a little bit more time to cook things well. Excellent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mix in some local favorite restaurants  - after all, we want them to be open post-Covid - but there are problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meal planning is still meal planning. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a chore. And it&amp;rsquo;s very easy for someone to complain about repetition, or general lack of variety. What are we to do??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;em&gt;How we plan home meals: A software story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Problems to Solve&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are we meals are eating this week? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where should we take out from tonight?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What recipes/restaurants do we like? And not like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we reduce repetition of meals/restaurants? (We like variety!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we minimize time spent menu planning or choosing a restaurant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Iteration 1: Spreadsheet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April I started a spreadsheet with one night per row, recording the date, the recipe, a link to the recipe, and if we liked it. If we brought in from a restaurant, we recorded the restaurant and a link to their menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just simple columns. I did some conditional formatting for restaurants vs. home-cooked. But nothing more than this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was time to plan food for the week, I’d look over the sheet and pick 4 or 5 meals, prioritizing time since last cooked. I’d add 1 or 2 new recipes each week (from various sources online). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to recipes, when we decided we wanted to eat out, we’d look at the top of the sheet and look for restaurants we’d not visited in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solved most of these problems, but the planning time could have been better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Problems to Solve&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were guessing on age since last cooked or last visited. This was not calculated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were not counting the # of times cooked/visited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrolling up and down spreadsheet rows make it hard to see history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We discovered we would like to rate recipes and restaurants - we wanted to be able to choose not just based on most-recently-eaten&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Iteration 2: AirTable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People had been suggesting AirTable for a while - the “NEVER use a spreadsheet to solve a software problem” crowd. 🙄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely have built my share of spreadsheets that slowly acrete functions, and SQL-esque queries, and yes, even JavaScript. And I also hate myself. And the [sunk-cost fallacy][sunk]. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spreadsheets are great. Until they aren&amp;rsquo;t. Which meant for iteration 2, I was going to try AirTable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a rough sketch of the implementation. I tweaked it regularly to refine, but here’s where we are today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3 Tables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restaurants: Name, Rating (1-3 stars), Notes, Count of times linked to Meal, Roll-up to get most-recent-visit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recipes: Name, Rating (1-3 stars), Web Link, Notes, Count of times linked to Meal, Roll-up to get most-recent-visit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meals: Date, link to Recipe (can be multiple), Link to Restaurant (can be multiple)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Meal is something we ate on a specific date - really just a join, but AirTable calls them &amp;ldquo;links&amp;rdquo;. Each day can have multiple meals and/or restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AirTable has &lt;em&gt;Views&lt;/em&gt;, which are sort of like database views. But they are also the visual UI for working with a given table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meals has a Calendar view. This is amazingly cool for planning. Meals has a web form for recording what/where we ate when, complete with calendar widget. Restaurants &amp;amp; Recipes each has a web form for a new record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restaurants &amp;amp; Recipes each has a “Choice View” that sorts first by least-recent-meal (ascending &amp;ldquo;roll-up&amp;rdquo; by date), then by rating (descending star count).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All views hide any extra fields that don&amp;rsquo;t help with the interaction at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Restaurants vs. Recipes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to be able to tell when a meal was home-cooked or a restaurant visit. The idea was to be able to scan and see how much we were eating out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the &amp;ldquo;name&amp;rdquo; field on Restaurants is now a formula that prepends 🍱 to every restaurant name. It’s now very easy to scan the calendar. Unicode FTW!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Multiple Meals in a Night&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night we couldn’t decide on a pizzeria. It was getting knock-down, drag out. So we ordered from both. Another night the kids wanted to make a Taco Bell run. So my wife and I decided to cook something we knew they hated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AirTable allows for multiple links to the same date. Meals now allow multiple-links records to Restaurants &amp;amp; Recipes. This gave us the bonus of being able to start tracking multiple side dishes on cooking nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;🌮TACO TUESDAY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to embrace Taco Tuesday! Every Tuesday we have Taco Night, which means wanting to track recipes that are taco-friendly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We added a Taco? yes/no &amp;ldquo;choice&amp;rdquo; field to recipes. And we added a Taco-specific view for when we wanted to pick this week&amp;rsquo;s taco proteins. And since we&amp;rsquo;d learned about Unicode support, Taco recipe names are always prepended with 🌮, based on the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Restaurant Closed?!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oops. COVID-19 claimed a business. We added a “Closed/Avoid” selection field that allows us to filter the closed places out of the Choice view. And we can use this if we have a lousy experience at a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summing Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning is now a simple pass over the Choice Views, looking at what we like but have not done recently. Pick 4-5, iterate. Option anxiety reduced. It&amp;rsquo;s also easy to answer, &amp;ldquo;DIDN&amp;rsquo;T WE JUST HAVE THAT?&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did I learn? A spreadsheet is a great place to start with any new app that is data-related. There&amp;rsquo;s a threshold you cross where project&amp;rsquo;s complexity begs for multiple tabs, conditional logic, and &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt; queries. When you see that threshold, taking a look at &lt;a href="https://www.airtable.com"&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt;, or maybe the newly announced &lt;a href="https://tables.area120.google.com/u/0/home"&gt;Google Tables&lt;/a&gt;, is a good investment.&lt;/p&gt;

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Your software development team has a daily standup meeting. How’s that going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams at Pivotal had a fairly common agenda for standup. We reviewed Helps (“I need help with…”), Interestings (“Yesterday I learned that…), and Events (“What are we doing besides coding today?”). We rarely got into the details of specific work unless there were team-wide concerns or if someone had a specific question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping to this agenda daily and keeping the ritual alive over time takes effort. We wrote a &lt;a href="https://github.com/pivotal-legacy/whiteboard"&gt;Rails app&lt;/a&gt; to help. Over time we realized that there are additional, some emergent, problems that cropped up during our meetings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Standup Problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen many problems in common across several teams. Some are just informational: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the agenda for today’s standup?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I find an item to discuss at standup tomorrow, how do I not forget to bring it up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which events are coming up in the next week?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who’s on vacation and when?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What stories (or epics, or tracks) is the team working on? Which pairs are working on them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are today’s pair assignments?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the active action items I have from team retrospectives?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others problems are more structural:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is enough structure to make the meeting productive, but not so much to be a burden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ritual is lightweight enough to allow for iteration, but solid enough to perpetuate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having some sort of physical board present in a team’s area can work well. Put this information in one place, use it to drive the daily ritual, and it lives the rest of the day as an information radiator for the team and the rest of the office. Some Cloud Foundry teams even had &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fuji+instax&amp;amp;crid=30RYK9F4OJF9A&amp;amp;sprefix=fuji+insta%2Caps%2C203&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_6_10"&gt;Fuji Instax&lt;/a&gt; photos of each team member and moved them around to identify pairings and which stories they were implementing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical board breaks down as soon as the team has one remote team member. Given how COVID-19 has made so many teams fully remote, what can we do? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We move the board online. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Credit to the Cloud Foundry CAPI team - a semi-remote team even in 2018 - where I first saw this solution.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An online kanban board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital avatar photos of each team member&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A standup agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to use &lt;a href="https://trello.com"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; in this example, but things like &lt;a href="https://miro.com"&gt;Miro&lt;/a&gt; or even a &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com"&gt;Google Spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; can work. For the agenda, I’m going to use Helps/Interesting/Events/Pairing Assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you should set it up like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Left Column is “Standup”; it holds divider cards for each agenda item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next Columns are just labeled “Track”; we’ll have 2 tracks in this example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next column is the “Pairing Parking Lot”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, a column for the “Retro Action Items”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Now you can add one card for each team member to the Pairing Parking Lot. Your board should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/standup/early-63201996.jpg" alt="Early Setup" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone on the team should have access to this board so they can add cards as needed during the day. Peer teams can have read or read/write access, depending on your organization’s norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great! How do we use it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Standup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standup is probably in a video call with everyone present. The emcee can now share their screen, reviewing cards in the lefthand column, top-to-bottom. Trello allows for a single keystroke to archive cards as you finish them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pair Assignments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the lefthand column is complete the team can discuss the day’s work. This means shuffling and assigning pairs to the available tracks of work. Whatever your pair rotation strategy - daily splits, track anchoring, etc. - your decisions should be reflected by moving the cards around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Pairing Lot” is a place to put people’s cards when they are away from the team. Or while you decide assignments for the day (hence the example’s dividers for available/unavailable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Retrospective Action Items&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This board can also be a place to track and remind team members about their action items from retrospectives. Even if you use software to run your retros, this board can surface them daily. Action items that stay top-of-mind are more likely to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;As Things Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In full use, the board will look more like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/standup/full_setup-7e21b62b.jpg" alt="Full Standup" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(or play with the &lt;a href="https://trello.com/b/qcJ1Ba56/standup-example#"&gt;live example&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After standup, changes that affect the team should lead to updating the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vacation on the horizon? Or team rotation about to happen? Add a card to Events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a help or interesting during the day? Add a card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New team member? Add their card. On their first day, use the exercise of adding their photo to verify they have access and then explain the ritual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a new story or track? Rename the Track column. Or even better? Add a card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another team member action item pops up? Add a card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Iteration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A developer may look at this and see opportunities for automation. Or maybe frustration that software isn’t choosing pairings, or tracking frequency of certain pairs…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a starting point. It is ripe for innovation and iteration. Knock yourself out. But be careful of the yaks you choose to shave - it’s just for five minutes out of your team’s day. Do what works.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tweetstorm I wrote up from being at a very early Foo Fighters&amp;rsquo; show. I&amp;rsquo;ve kept this in Tweet format because I wrote it in 280-word segments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash;dwf&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My Amazing Rock’n’Roll moments. Next in a series. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Foo Fighters first tour. May 13th 1995. Or maybe the July show. Portland, Oregon. La Luna. An amazing venue that doesn’t do rock shows anymore. 1/7&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Thank You for being a VOTER (@dwfrank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwfrank/status/1305724884052443136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;But an absolutely AMAZING mosh pit. Near the end of the show, the band took a short breather to change guitars or something. And we all stood there, spent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then they started “Exhausted.” But nobody was dancing. We were all too tired. 2/7&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Thank You for being a VOTER (@dwfrank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwfrank/status/1305724884799037440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I was in the middle of the room at the edge of a big circle of people. I wanted to keep the excitement. After a 30 seconds or so, when the song is still slow, I tucked in my arms and started rolling slowly to the tempo off of everyone along the inside of the circle. 3/7&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Thank You for being a VOTER (@dwfrank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwfrank/status/1305724885503602689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just me became two or three, then four people. Not crazy dancing, but just building. And building. Just like the song. By the crescendo we had the pit at full strength. That song felt like it went on forever. Just forever. It was so special. 4/7&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Thank You for being a VOTER (@dwfrank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwfrank/status/1305724886187302915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Fast forward about 4 months. The tour is wrapping up. And I’m listening to a Westwood One interview with the band on a Sunday night. They start taking calls from the audience. “What was your favorite show during this tour?” 5/7&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Thank You for being a VOTER (@dwfrank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwfrank/status/1305724886896144384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Dave Grohl- “It’s just so great to be on tour. That we’ve picked up fans and they’ve embraced us. And the shows everywhere have been beyond what we’ve could have ever expected.” 6/7&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Thank You for being a VOTER (@dwfrank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwfrank/status/1305724887579779072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Then one of the other band members jumps in. “You member that one night in Portland? When they started MOSHING? To f’n EXHAUSTED? That never happens.” Dave - “Oh, yeah. By the end that was NUTS. What a show!”&lt;br&gt;🎸🕺🤘 &lt;br&gt;7/7&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Thank You for being a VOTER (@dwfrank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwfrank/status/1305724888284504064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I originally published this on &lt;a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/drake-your-job-5c55b706bb18"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few copy edits, but the content and intent is the same. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash;dwf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much do you love your job? You can measure some job characteristics like salary, benefits, or round-trip commute time. But what about the intangibles? Do you have a good manager? Are you learning? Are you happy? Measuring these abstract things seems hard. But if we can’t measure it, how can we improve it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you measured everything about your job and calculated an overall score? You could pick an area to change to improve your score. Or you could compare the score of your current job and new potential jobs. How can you turn this mix of concrete numbers, fuzzy feelings, and abstract concepts into useful information in order to help direct your career?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Drake Equation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the birth of SETI.org, Dr. Frank Drake decided to estimate the number of potential planets with intelligent life. And while it’s a very rough estimate, the birth of the Drake Equation calculated a number that inspired scientists to reach for the stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with valuing your job?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Dearing of Harrison Metal has &lt;a href="https://www.harrisonmetal.com/library/drake-s-equation"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mcgd/drakes-equation-e967535a76ac"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that shares the Drake Equation’s history and suggests that it’s applicable to any seemingly unquantifiable thing. What would it look like to build a “Drake Job Equation,” taking into consideration all the components of your job? Let’s give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What’s Important?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, list which job characteristics are important to you. Take some time and make a list. Here’s what I came up with, based on what matters to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compensation&lt;/em&gt; — Money matters! Base salary, any bonus, stock options or shares, and benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Organization&lt;/em&gt; — How do I feel about the company or organization? Do my leaders inspire me? Do my values align?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manager&lt;/em&gt; — Is my manager helpful in my career? Do we meet regularly? Do they listen? Do they explain the “Why?” as well as the “What?” when I have questions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peers&lt;/em&gt; — Do they have my trust and respect? Do I have coffee and lunch buddies? Do I invite them over for dinner?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commute&lt;/em&gt; — How long do I spend getting to the job every day? Does it leave me enough time for the rest of my life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Office location&lt;/em&gt; — Is the office in a place that inspires me daily? Is it easy to schedule time with my friends and mentors at other companies? Can I run errands at lunch?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company’s main product or service&lt;/em&gt; — Is my work going toward a product or service that I admire or respect? That I would use regularly? Would I be proud to recommend it to friends and family?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The work&lt;/em&gt; — Is my work energizing? Is it fun? Is it interesting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opportunity to learn&lt;/em&gt; — Are I adding to my skillset? Is this job going to help me get the next one?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Drake Job Equation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a list of potential terms, you need to combine them into a Drake equation. Let’s assume that the compensation is the base of your score. The other terms should increase or decrease that to get a final value. The bigger the score, the better the job is likely to be. A lower score should be a catalyst to do some deeper thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining my terms, I got this formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Value.job = 
    Comp × 
    Q.org × 
    Q.mgr × 
    Q.peers × 
    Q.commute × 
    Q.location × 
    M.product ×
    M.work × 
    Freq.learning
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C is compensation. Start with cash salary. Add any bonuses. Add the net gain from any stock options, RSU’s, or an employee stock program. And don’t forget any other benefits — health insurance, discount on public transit, gym memberships, etc. Add those in. If you don’t have exact amounts for any of your compensation numbers — for example, your company isn’t public yet so you can only guess about stock options — just make a reasonable estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next group of other terms is for “quality” terms. Each of these terms needs a range of values that reduces or amplifies the score based on each term’s impact. I recommend a range of 0.1 to 2. A value of 0.1 maps to “poor quality” or “this part of my job sucks.” This low term should be pulling down the overall job score. Why 0.1? Because we need to talk about zeroes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any low term will pull your score down significantly. Be honest as you ask yourself about each term. But a zero will make the entire score zero. If your final job score is zero, it’s probably time to open up LinkedIn. A value of 0.1 serves as a nice floor that sends the right message without screaming “QUIT” and rendering the rest of the formula moot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 1 means things are “just OK”. A value of 1 doesn’t reduce or amplify the overall score. A 2 means that things are “GREAT”, meaning it doubles your overall score. And keeping the ceiling at 2 means that any one term does not overwhelm the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quality of Organization:&lt;/em&gt; Q.org score between 0.1 and 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quality of Manager:&lt;/em&gt; Q.mgr score between 0.1 and 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quality of Peers:&lt;/em&gt; Q.peers score between 0.1 and 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quality of Commute:&lt;/em&gt; Q.commute score between 0.1 and 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quality of Location:&lt;/em&gt; Q.location score between 0.1 and 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next group is for motivation scores. Motivation matters a lot to me, so I decided on a higher ceiling of 5. Feel free to tweak these ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motivation from Product:&lt;/em&gt; M.product score between 0.1 and 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motivation from Work:&lt;/em&gt; M.work score between 0.1 and 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frequency of Learning Opportunities:&lt;/em&gt; Freq.learning score between 0.1 and 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using The Equation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your total compensation comes out to $50,000 this year. You love the company, have a pretty good manager, fine teammates, a soul-sucking commute, a great location, you love the product, don’t love the work you’re doing, and you are learning a reasonable amount. Using my equation, we get this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50,000 * 2 * 1.25 * 1 * 0.25 * 2 * 3 * 2 * 3 = 1,125,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have a score. What do you do with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just doing the evaluation is helpful. You now have a list of items worth investigating for improvement — those things that are preventing you from getting more out of your current job. Your commute is awful, but you love the location. Can you carpool with some coworkers? Is there a public transit option? Your current work isn’t exciting, but you like the company and product. Can you bring this up with your manager? Could you transfer to another job in the company?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the areas for improvement are all outside of your control, maybe it’s time to look for a new job. Evaluate each term as you interview at a company and score each opportunity. Compare these scores as you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won’t have an offer yet, but you can play with the compensation value. What compensation amount would make you take an offer? Haven’t met enough of the team to make a guess about the peers? Schedule a follow-up lunch. Curious about other aspects of the new job? Use your network to find folks who can help you refine your estimates. There will be lots of ambiguity. Resolve what you can and estimate the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting to a score is a tool, not a conclusion. So get as close as is practical that helps you answer the question at hand. Do you love your job? How about your next one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the components of &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; Drake Job Equation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;dwf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a Soundgarden story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 1990, London. I was helping chaperone some high school students on a canonical &amp;ldquo;American Suburban Kid European Tour.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s after 11pm. Everything is closed, so we headed back from wandering around town to sit and talk in the lobby lounge of our nice, but much older hotel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been there for some time when the window to the street slides open. Four dudes, dressed all in black, and &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; drunk, crawl through and plotzed down in the chairs next to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Soundgarden. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kids didn&amp;rsquo;t know them. I barely did. A hotel clerk walked over and closed the window, saying a very English nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked music with Kim Thayil for a bit. &amp;ldquo;Athens. We played Athens. I love Athens. Come see us next time we&amp;rsquo;re in town.&amp;rdquo; Sadly, I never saw them live. In Athens or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I remember of Chris Cornell was the &lt;em&gt;hair&lt;/em&gt;. And the high school girls crushing just by staring into those eyes (when they were open). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some time a different clerk came and shooed us all out of the lobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I became a fan. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dApSggATER4"&gt;Badmotorfinger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbNIR6dkgNY&amp;amp;list=PLnif9Rfb5AdnVpmUboC3SEZFbcGu80Ea8"&gt;Superunknown&lt;/a&gt; are great albums. That &lt;em&gt;voice&lt;/em&gt;. His &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_T5aLjJ048"&gt;Ave Maria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is key to my Christmas playlist. I miss him even though I&amp;rsquo;ve not liked his more recent songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love your friends. Especially when you know they hurt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what #adulting is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;dwf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t much of a Talking Heads fan. I liked them fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciated their quirky melodies &amp;amp; artsy videos in contrast to the rest of early MTV. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That changed when the older brother of a friend heard I had not only a stereo VCR, but an amplifier and a tape deck that connected to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus I found myself one Friday evening taping to cassette (you know, chrome-age “ripping”), the entirety of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Making_Sense"&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/a&gt; with someone I didn’t know that well. By the end of the night, we were both excited to have one of the best rock concert movies that we could play just about anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likely watching &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storefront_Hitchcock"&gt;Storefront Hitchcock&lt;/a&gt; tonight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIP and &lt;em&gt;Thank You&lt;/em&gt;, Mr. Demme.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How One Funny Email Almost Changed My Career</title>

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash;dwf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006 it was time that I left my job at Palm. When you leave a job in tech, you send a goodbye email.
When you think yourself a fun and funny co-worker, you want that email to be &lt;em&gt;hilarious&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject: Where&amp;rsquo;s DWF? as of 6/2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for your good wishes in the past week. Many of you have asked what I&amp;rsquo;m going to be doing after Palm. You know I can&amp;rsquo;t keep a secret from you guys for long. So here are the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to get out of the crazy world of high tech and pursue success in the low-margin, high hype world of the beverage industry. It won&amp;rsquo;t be long before my line of energy drinks, GoJ (pronounced &amp;ldquo;GO-J&amp;rdquo;), hits the shelves of your local quickie-, super- or mega-mart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GoJ will start with good old-fashioned orange juice and finish laced with the FDA maximum concentration of caffeine. None of this high fructose corn syrup water that tastes like it might have been mixed in an orange container. Instead we&amp;rsquo;ll use only the best fresh-squeezed, flash-pasteurized juice mixed with the purest caffeine molecules our state-of-the-art laboratory can synthesize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first target customers are the Slashdot crowd, selling them on the fact that one 500ml bottle not only has the equivalent caffeine to 6 cans of Jolt Cola or 4 cans of Red Bull (or just one cup of 2nd-floor Peet&amp;rsquo;s coffee), but it also meets their recommended daily allowance of fruits and vegetables. The web ad campaign, with our initial slogan &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m on it!&amp;rdquo;, will run late summer featuring none other than Palm&amp;rsquo;s own &lt;NAME REDACTED&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we&amp;rsquo;ll move to a broader customer base with other flavors, including lemonade, strawberry-kiwi, and a proprietary blend of guava, apple, starfruit and pineapple we&amp;rsquo;re calling &amp;ldquo;GoJ-GASP.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point we&amp;rsquo;ll need a sports celebrity spokesperson. I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to announce that we&amp;rsquo;re in negotiations to sign Barry Bonds. Millions of kids will drink GoJ and declare under oath our new slogan &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the juice!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in touch. I&amp;rsquo;m on LinkedIn. And if ever want to make the leap out of tech, we&amp;rsquo;ll be looking for people to drive the delivery trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;dwf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the laughs, kudos and high-fives I wanted. And I went on with my last days. But funny emails get forwarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last few days were spent explaining the joke. And the references. And the fact that no, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any juice you could try. Or delivery trucks. Or job applications. Or a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three weeks later, I got a call from a friend-of-a-friend-of-a-coworker who was a beverage distributor in LA. I think he wanted to invest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight years later, at a Handspring/Palm reunion party I was talking shop with someone who received the email directly that day. She looked at me, squinted and asked, &amp;ldquo;Wait. I thought you were making juice?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How We XP: Develop &amp; Deploy</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally written (and posted to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@dwfrank/how-we-xp-develop-deploy-13faf089420b"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;) for a friend who while around software for a while, and seen some agile teams, he was just starting to manage one directly. So I wrote up this bit of a braindump.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash;dwf&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into planning. That&amp;rsquo;s another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume that stories &amp;mdash; the work that is to be done &amp;mdash; are broken into small, individually-acceptable pieces of work. &amp;ldquo;Acceptable&amp;rdquo; means that a Product Manager (PM) can verify that developers did the agreed work completely. Keeping the stories small means it is easier to make progress, show progress, and validate progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also assuming that the team is using git for version control, the developers are test-driving their code (Test-driven Development or TDD), the current test suite is green on a Continuous Integration system (CI), and that we are talking about a web app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All new development is done locally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers pull up to latest code and run the test suite. It should be green. If not, fix it and push back to origin before continuing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers test drive the new feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When developers think the story is done based on the acceptance criteria agreed-upon with the PM, all tests should be green and the new functionality should be working as expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a great time for developers to find refactoring or dead code and clean those up as well. Tests should stay green.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers now pull up to latest code from origin in case another part of the team has pushed new code. If there are changes, merge and run tests again. If there are broken tests, fix them before continuing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional: some teams like feature branches. They should be short-lived and merged/re-based with master often. The longer your changes stay away from master, the more tech debt you create. Merge early, merge often. Git-flow is a pretty good pattern here.
= Once all tests are green locally and all changes are ahead of origin master, push to origin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Continuous Integration (CI)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your git repo should have a post-commit hook that starts a CI build. On every push to master, no exceptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a full test run on a server that looks as close to your Production deploy configuration as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This can be a long pipeline. Run unit tests, run integrations and functional tests and regression tests - whatever. Often your pipeline will have later stages that integrate multiple apps/services and cross-browser tests. Make sure you are getting feedback at all stages of the pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When CI is green all the way, you should have a CI step that deploys to Staging. This should happen several times per day. And if it&amp;rsquo;s automated, even better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Staging (aka Acceptance)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staging is a deployment (or environment) that looks exactly like Production, with the same versions of OS, database, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staging doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to serve the same capacity &amp;mdash; so maybe just a primary database (no replication or secondaries ). Since there will be fewer active users, you probably only need one app server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional: If your system has feature that needs acceptance that requires master/slave DB or app server failover, then by all means install/configure Staging to match that configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone should know when a Staging deploy is done and what new work it contains. Notify the team via email or an information radiator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM should verify work is done as expected on Staging. Validating that work is complete is PM&amp;rsquo;s role, Not QA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If work is not satisfactory, Reject the work. Rejected work should be started before any new work is started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If something is broken that used to work, PM writes a bug. PM should prioritize bugs against other work. That is, a given bug may not be as important to fix as some new feature stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;QA should be looking at Staging to find bugs, problems, regressions, or any inconsistencies. They should be using the product as a user would and should be looking for behavior that engineering and product didn&amp;rsquo;t find. This is often called exploratory QA. You should have your QA lead read the book on Exploratory QA, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Explore-Increase-Confidence-Exploratory-Testing/dp/1937785025"&gt;Explore It!&lt;/a&gt; written by my good friend and colleague, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/testobsessed"&gt;Elisabeth Hendrickson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Production&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production is where the shipping product lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When all stories on Staging have been accepted, PM should consider pushing that version of the code to Production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If users will have a bad experience due to known bugs or an incomplete user experience, then don&amp;rsquo;t push to Production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push to Production has often as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Other Deploys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is by no means exhaustive. But small-to-medium-sized projects tend to have one or more of these deploys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Patch Staging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A copy of Staging, meant as a short-lived deploy just to verify a hot-fix. Using a second Staging means mainline work doesn&amp;rsquo;t slow down while a patch is developed and shipped. Same rules as Staging apply, but tear this deploy down as soon as the fix is deployed to Production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Demo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A copy of Staging, meant as a short-lived deploy for specific set of users for a short amount of time. Like a PatchGood use cases for a Demo deploy include demoing to potential investors and user research. Tear this deploy down as soon as the demo is over or when feedback is no longer required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Integration/User Acceptance Test&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A copy of Staging that can be used for more real-world testing. This usually stays in line with the normal Staging and is used for CI pipelines. Some examples are performance testing, smoke testing, and long user scenario testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not Scary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s described above is Continuous Delivery; insist that code always move in one direction: towards Production. Also, set up the whole team so that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to move towards Production and release often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Production Patches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how you should deal with hot-fixes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers branch from the last Production deploy version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers fix the bug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CI runs against this version of the code to ensure no regressions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers deploy this version to a temporary Staging environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PM accepts the fix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers push this branch to Production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers merge the fix back to master.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sometimes Scary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Continuous Deployment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some teams are able to push &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; green build to Production. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to cover this in this post. But there is additional process and code needed to support this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the things you should truly worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Long duration test suites&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your test suite or CI pipeline is too long, you run the risk of completing work faster than you can verify it. If you keep locally-run suites fast - say, under 10–20 minutes - then your developers can get features to staging multiple times a day. Long CI pipelines are less awful. For example, a web app can have a multi-stage pipeline that puts an all-browser compatibility suite near the end. Main development can continue based on success of unit tests, collaboration tests, and one browser stage of tests. Then the multi-browser suite can run once or twice a day, and browser-based problems from that stage can be bugs that get prioritized against other work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Long-lived branches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like long test suites, this can keep your feedback loops long. In this case you have bigger risks around the rest of your app changing faster than the branch&amp;rsquo;s work can keep up. If it&amp;rsquo;s taking too long to merge something back to master, then consider that the work should be broken up into smaller bits or should be started when its dependencies are more stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Complex merges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This usually comes from long-lived branches. Keeping all development on master helps to minimize this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Manual deployment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;either manual configurations and/or inconsistent deployments from Product &amp;amp; Staging. These are often related. You want Staging, Production, and any other deploys to have consistent configuration. Bugs due to different code interpreters, databases or OS libraries are very subtle and guaranteed time wasters. Invest in DevOps or a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) in order to keep your deploys consistent and repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Breaking the Stream&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code should always move towards Production. It increases the confidence in the code and keeps regressions low. When a fix is made downstream of development, then it&amp;rsquo;s harder than normal development to integrate that fix back in development.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a set of Bose QC2 noise-canceling headphones that I use every day. I bought them in late 2007. They don&amp;rsquo;t make my BART commute quiet, but they make it tolerable enough that I can listen to music and podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the first year the wire started to fray a little. I walked into the Bose store in San Francisco and without blinking they gave me a new cable. Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another couple of years later and my sweaty, bald head had caused the ear cups and cushioned underside of the head band to wear out. I ordered new ear cups ($35 + shipping) from their website and made a mental note to call tech support about replacing the headband when I had a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday two things happened. First, the new ear cups arrived. And then I noticed the cable fraying again in the same spot - the insulation is pulling away from the jack. So now time to call and ask what should I do. I want to order the cable and the headband.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tyler has the rep who got my call. The cable was $15 and easy to replace. But the headband piece was not replaceable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So you&amp;rsquo;ve already spent the $35 for the cups. I can certainly send you a new cable, which is $15 plus shipping. But we&amp;rsquo;re certainly sorry that you&amp;rsquo;ve had these issues with our product - they really should last longer than the few years you&amp;rsquo;ve had them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I replied that the electronics are fine. But my glands are just outside Bose&amp;rsquo;s tolerances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s what we can do - for $89, plus tax and shipping, and $5 to ship your old headphones back to us, I can send you our newest equivalent model. We just released it in the last year or so and they&amp;rsquo;re lots better anyway.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Really.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I need to ship them right away? I&amp;rsquo;d like to use them on a business trip next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No problem. Print the mailing label when you get it in your email - it expires in a week. But the label is good for 90 days. If we don&amp;rsquo;t receive the old set by then, we&amp;rsquo;ll cancel the whole thing. So drop it in the mail when you get back. You&amp;rsquo;re all set. I&amp;rsquo;ll transfer you to our RMA department to send back the ear cups you&amp;rsquo;ve already received. No problem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the second rep&amp;rsquo;s name, but he finished the transaction before I could tell him the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to give Bose the benefit of the doubt that they&amp;rsquo;ll refurb what they can and dispose of the parts they can&amp;rsquo;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile? Super Happy Customer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back to Work&amp;rsquo;s episode &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/8"&gt;Little Velvet Hands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was in my head the other day, so I used it in a teachable moment with my son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just took a family trip to Phoenix, AZ to catch a little Giants Spring Training (Merlin, that&amp;rsquo;s cricket). When we fly, we always have the kids, 5 &amp;amp; 9, pack &amp;amp; pull their own roller bags. All the better to teach how to navigate the whole airport thing. Plus ownership &amp;amp; responsibility is good, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trip they wanted to check their bags. BAGS FLY FREE on Southwest, so why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flight home, we land at SFO and they lost my son&amp;rsquo;s bag - he&amp;rsquo;s the 5 year old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boy,  &amp;ldquo;WHOO-HOO! I DON&amp;rsquo;T HAVE TO UNPACK TONIGHT!&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As awesome as that is, that&amp;rsquo;s not what I came here to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood in line, behind bunches of the seriously grumpy people, I gave my phone number, I got the receipt. And we left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Southwest called the next day to say the bag had been found they gave me the option to have it delivered or come pick it up and get a $50 voucher . We live close to SFO so I chose the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to bring the boy. It was, after all, his bag. And he needed to pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we drove to the airport. I gave him the receipt. We walked in to the empty Southwest baggage claim area and to the baggage desk. Behind it was one woman who was clearly on a soul-sucking phone call in the middle of a soulless shift. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When that call ended, she looked at me and said, nearly perky, &amp;ldquo;Can I help you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then a 5 year old boy pointed to the corner, handed her his receipt, and said, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s my suitcase.&amp;rdquo;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She beamed. &amp;ldquo;Well then let&amp;rsquo;s get it checked out so you can take it home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clickity-clickity-clackity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boy, &amp;ldquo;What happened so that my bag wasn&amp;rsquo;t with everybody else&amp;rsquo;s bags?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She, grinning, &amp;ldquo;Somebody forgot to put it on your plane. But we put it on the next one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boy, &amp;ldquo;You mean from Arizona?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She, &amp;ldquo;Yep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boy, &amp;ldquo;Ok.&amp;rdquo; &lt;beat&gt; &amp;ldquo;Thank you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent this to not only to brag. But because what we talked about all the way home is how the lady was there waiting for him and that he made her smile while she did her job because he was nice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that most people she dealt with during her day were mad that their luggage was missing and were NOT NICE to her. So it was important to remember that it was helpful to be nice when you can because it makes people smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That and he had to unpack his bag when we got home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boy, &amp;ldquo;Oh, MAN!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
