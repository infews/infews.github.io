I find this invaluable for jump starting my day.\n\nI use the date format of YYYY.MM.DD, which helps with sorting when looking for a day’s note outside of Obsidian - say, on mobile or via the file system.\n\nAs of this writing, my template looks like this:\n\n# Exercise\n\n# Calendar\n\n# Work\n\n---\n#dailynotes\n\n\nI like logging my daily exercise. So that’s obvious. I tend to exercise first thing in the morning, so when I open this note, I log the workouts right away.\n\nThe “Work” section is for stuff I did today that needs some context - beyond, say, what’s in my personal task manager. I often will have items here like “wrote some for the blog” or “talked to neighbor about the fence” just to tickle my brain when I come back to this file.\n\nThe “Calendar” section is full of entries of the meetings I know I’m going to have, or if spontaneous ones happen, I add them, too. They look like this:\n\n# Calendar\n\n## 1100a Talk with [[Andy Nelson]]\n\n## 0230p 1-1 with [[Kyle]]\n\n\nI will take bulleted list notes in these sections during the meeting if possible. And anything that I need to dump out of my brain after the meeting, I’ll flesh out the section.\n\nI talk about linking to people in Obsidian 1-1’s.\n","@context":"https://schema.org"}
