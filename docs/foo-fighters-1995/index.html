Portland, Oregon. La Luna. An amazing venue that doesn’t do rock shows anymore.\n\nBut an absolutely AMAZING mosh pit. Near the end of the show, the band took a short breather to change guitars or something. And we all stood there, spent.Then they started “Exhausted.” But nobody was dancing. We were all too tired.\n\nI was in the middle of the room at the edge of a big circle of people. I wanted to keep the excitement. After a 30 seconds or so, when the song is still slow, I tucked in my arms and started rolling slowly to the tempo off of everyone along the inside of the circle.\n\nJust me became two or three, then four people. Not crazy dancing, but just building. And building. Just like the song. By the crescendo we had the pit at full strength. That song felt like it went on forever. Just forever. It was so special.\n\nFast forward about 4 months. The tour is wrapping up. And I’m listening to a Westwood One radio interview with the band on a Sunday night. They start taking calls from the audience. “What was your favorite show during this tour?”\n\nDave Grohl - “It’s just so great to be on tour. That we’ve picked up fans and they’ve embraced us. And the shows everywhere have been beyond what we’ve could have ever expected.”\n\nThen one of the other band members jumps in. “Remember that one night in Portland? When they started moshing? To f’n Exhausted ? That never happens.”\n\nDave - “Oh, yeah. So cool. By the end of the song that was nuts. What a show!”\n\n\n  \n    \n      I think it was likely the May show, as I recall it being short. Regardless, it makes a better story with Exhausted being the last song. \u0026#8617;\n    \n  \n\n","@context":"https://schema.org"}
