Something light and fun so that the attendee’s brains could catch up a bit between deep technical sessions.\n\nI knew exactly which stories I wanted to pull together. And it was a lot of fun to give.\n\nI had mostly forgotten about this talk and totally forgotten that it was recorded. So imagine my surprise when I \nuncovered the video this week. And that it had 200+ views!\n\nIf you’re curious, or you were there and want the 10-year flashback, or maybe just want a ten-minute break today, here it is. I hope you enjoy it.\n\nGoGaRuCo 2013 - Afternoon Storytime - How I test-drove my Career (YouTube)\n\n","@context":"https://schema.org"}
