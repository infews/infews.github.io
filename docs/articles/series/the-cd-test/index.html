I have seen test frameworks come and go. I have seen all manner of Agile dogma ebb and flow. Pivotal’s process is was firmly rooted in <a href="http://extremeprogramming.org" data-proofer-ignore="">Extreme Programming</a>, but like any good process it adapted. We incorporated concepts from <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/learningpaths/application-development/balanced-teams/">Balanced Team</a> and <a href="https://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a>. “XP” and “Agile” have become loaded terms, so I’ve switched to using the term “Continuous Delivery,” or just “CD.”</p> <p>I often get asked the question, “How can I introduce CD to my team?” There are as many ways to make the journey as there are teams. I wrote the following blog post to give you and your team a guide. It’s a way to measure your process now. And can used as a “to do” list for how to proceed.</p> <p>First up, a test.</p> </main> <footer class=site> <p class=small>© Davis W.
