I’ve gone all digital, all paper (thanks, <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journal</a>), and various mixes of the two.</p> <p>The biggest leap forward for me with computer-based note taking was switching to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a>, which is Brett Terpstra’s fork of <a href="https://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a>. The key insight and feature was keeping each note as a Markdown file, living in a directory of all of my notes. NV has a “search or create” mentality that is empowering.</p> <p>A few months ago I switched computer-based note taking completely to <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>. There are enough additional features that I’ve found myself enriching my note taking practice, building new and better habits.</p> <p>Keeping notes as individual files in a directory meant nearly zero transition cost.</p> <p>While I use Markdown checklists - see below - I manage my projects and tasks with other tools. Notes - e.g., links, snippets of thoughts, longer form writing, daily journaling - are distinct and now <em>very</em> happy in my Obsidian vaults.</p> <p>I’m not the only one that’s found Obsidian recently. So this series is to capture the configuration, patterns, and practices I’ve found that are working for me. Your mileage <em>will</em> vary.</p> <p>For me, it all starts with the Daily Journal plugin.</p> </main> <footer class=site> <p class=small>© Davis W.
