I’ve gone all digital, all paper (thanks, <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journal</a>), and various mixes of the two.</p> <p>The biggest leap forward for me with computer-based note taking was switching to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a>, which is Brett Terpstra’s fork of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notational_Velocity">Notational Velocity</a>. The key insight and feature was keeping each note as a Markdown file, living in a directory of all of my notes. NV has a “search or create” mentality that is empowering.</p> <p>A few months ago I switched computer-based note taking completely to <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>. There are enough additional features that I’ve found myself enriching my note taking practice, building new and better habits.</p> <p>Keeping notes as individual files in a directory meant nearly zero transition cost.</p> <p>While I use Markdown checklists - see below - I manage my projects and tasks with other tools. Notes - e.g., links, snippets of thoughts, longer form writing, daily journaling - are distinct and now <em>very</em> happy in my Obsidian vaults.</p> <p>I’m not the only one that’s found Obsidian recently. So this series is to capture the configuration, patterns, and practices I’ve found that are working for me. Your mileage <em>will</em> vary.</p> <p>For me, it all starts with the Daily Journal plugin.</p> </section> <ul class=articles> <hr> <li><h3> <a class=title href='/core-plugin-daily-journal/'>Core Plugin: Daily Journal</a> </h3> <p class=teaser>The Daily Journal is key to remembering things.</p> <p class=date>21 March 2021</p> </li> <hr> <li><h3> <a class=title href='/core-plugin-templates/'>Core Plugin: Templates</a> </h3> <p class=teaser>DRY up your notes.</p> <p class=date>21 March 2021</p> </li> <hr> <li><h3> <a class=title href='/using-links/'>Using Links</a> </h3> <p class=teaser>Cross note linking that isn&#39;t Markdown is OK.</p> <p class=date>21 March 2021</p> </li> <hr> <li><h3> <a class=title href='/using-tags/'>Using Tags</a> </h3> <p class=teaser>Tag it for easier search.</p> <p class=date>21 March 2021</p> </li> <hr> <li><h3> <a class=title href='/community-plugin-calendar/'>Community Plugin: Calendar</a> </h3> <p class=teaser>The calendar helps you build the daily journal habit.</p> <p class=date>21 March 2021</p> </li> <hr> <li><h3> <a class=title href='/one-on-one-notes/'>Note Taking in 1-1&#39;s</a> </h3> <p class=teaser>1-1s are a special type of note.</p> <p class=date>21 March 2021</p> </li> <hr> <li><h3> <a class=title href='/thoughts-on-vaults/'>Thoughts on Vaults</a> </h3> <p class=teaser>When to Vault and when not to.</p> <p class=date>21 March 2021</p> </li> <hr> <li><h3> <a class=title href='/obsidian-links/'>Obsidian URLs</a> </h3> <p class=teaser>Linking to Obs from other apps is power.</p> <p class=date>21 March 2021</p> </li> <hr> <li><h3> <a class=title href='/love-the-command-palette/'>Don&#39;t Sleep on the Command Palette</a> </h3> <p class=teaser>It takes me a while to learn new commands.</p> <p class=date>21 March 2021</p> </li> <hr> <li><h3> <a class=title href='/cmd-o-is-my-new-and-old-friend/'>Cmd-O is My New and Old Friend</a> </h3> <p class=teaser>One keystroke for Obsidian search-or-create.
