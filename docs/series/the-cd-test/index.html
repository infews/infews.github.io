I have seen test frameworks come and go. I have seen all manner of Agile dogma ebb and flow. Pivotal’s process is was firmly rooted in <a href="http://extremeprogramming.org" data-proofer-ignore="">Extreme Programming</a>, but like any good process it adapted. We incorporated concepts from <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/learningpaths/application-development/balanced-teams/">Balanced Team</a> and <a href="https://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a>. “XP” and “Agile” have become loaded terms, so I’ve switched to using the term “Continuous Delivery,” or just “CD.”</p> <p>I often get asked the question, “How can I introduce CD to my team?” There are as many ways to make the journey as there are teams.
