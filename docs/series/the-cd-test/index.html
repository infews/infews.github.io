I have seen test frameworks come and go. I have seen all manner of Agile dogma ebb and flow. Pivotal&rsquo;s process is was firmly rooted in <a href="http://extremeprogramming.org">Extreme Programming</a>, but like any good process it adapted. We incorporated concepts from <a href="http://www.balancedteam.org/">Balanced Team</a> and <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a>. </p> <p>I often get asked the question, &ldquo;How can I start this with my team?&rdquo; There are as many ways to make the journey as there are teams. I wrote the following blog post to give you and your team a guide. It&rsquo;s a way to measure your process now. And can used as a &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list for how to proceed. </p> <p>First up, a test.</p> <ul id=post-list> <li> <a href='/the-continuous-delivery-test/'> <div>Introducing The Continuous Delivery Test</div> <div class=date> 5 November 2020</div> </a> </li> </ul> <p>What&rsquo;s next? Pick and choose from these sub-topics. I hope it helps you and your team. </p> <hr> <footer id=footer> <p class=small> © Davis W.
