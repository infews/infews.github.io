It’s got several yaks that needed everything from a light trim to a buzz-cut/rogaine special.  Like any good technical project rathole, I started with a dependency update…\n\nThis roughly 3-year-old site is a static site built with Middleman because I prefer Ruby, HAML, and Markdown. I wrote a few helpers, including a moderately interesting one for json+ld. I knew I wanted to do some restyling eventually. I needed to do a bundle update and to see what needed to change in the “guts” before getting to the markup/CSS.\n\nMiddleman updated to 4.5, HAML to 6.x, and I moved to Ruby 3.2.2. I then ran into a couple of intertwined problems with plugins and HAML. That led me to reconsider Middleman.\n\nBridgetown was the obvious next stop. But after a week of wrestling with its HAML support, I gave up. It wasn’t hard to migrate the content, but without full support of HAML components, I was building lots shim Liquid templates to keep most partials in HAML. It felt exactly like the type of work I would want to rip out later. It made more sense to me to stay with Middleman and fix the issues I’d found.\n\nThe dependency problems were with two plug-ins. I was using middleman-vcs-time for getting published times for feeds and json+ld. That plug-in has been archived, so I moved to File.mtime for now.\n\nNext was middleman-syntax which has some problems with HAML 6. Without a fix, I deferred this and jumped ahead.\n\nI had to make two changes for HAML 6 - succeed (thankfully) is gone, so I moved to string concatenation. I had a couple of places where I needed unescaped strings (thanks != !) (see again, json+ld).\n\nI knew I wanted to clean up my HTML to ASAP - As Semantic As Practical - so I did some research into classless CSS resets and settled on Holiday. It has some very nice, sensible defaults, making the kinds of changes I wanted to make clean and simple. This let me kill all of my old CSS, including my FontAwesome version-4-era self hosting, instead moving to their JS-based hosted free solution.\n\nNext up was a bunch of cleanup of layouts, HTML, and thus CSS. I had a few design changes I wanted to make that drove this. This was a lot of iterative tweaking, but I think my layouts and component partials are better factored than before. More deleted files!\n\nDuring the restyling, I found that even with Safari’s Responsive Developer Mode, the media queries aren’t quite right. This meant having the iPhone and iPad around with a cable for working the Console from my desktop for element inspection. You have to install the full Xcode to do this, but it is worth it.\n\nAll that done, I took a look at how I was customizing and configuring Middleman. I changed how I store and build my blog series (a custom collection). I do want these presented a little differently, and I had over-complicated them before. Now the series introduction page\\s are just in Markdown, like other articles/posts, and share a simple HAML template.\n\nNext up - the motivator for all of this work - was tweaking my resume. Before my resume was in HAML. I wanted to move this to (nearly) 100% Markdown to make maintenance easier. And I got there by making a custom HAML layout, which allowed me to move the social links (using Font Awesome) from HTML-in-Markdown to HAML.\n\nI was using RedCarpet for Markdown-to-HTML because it’s what middleman-syntax recommended. RedCarpet doesn’t support extended Markdown for HTML Definition Lists, which I use in my resume. Back to Kramdown (the Middleman default) for \u0026lt;dl\u0026gt;’s, installing [kramdown-parser-gfm][gfm] so I didn’t have to convert all my syntax-highlighting in articles to ~~~ (and change my brain), and finding a Pygments CSS file I liked. All pretty easy, but I’m still not thrilled with how the syntax highlighting looks for Markdown, so I may be revisiting this later.\n\nI version my resume with dates - this helps me personally and when talking with recruiters. Today this is manual and I wanted to make it automatic. Back to the resume HAML layout, where I added a line to shell out and get the last git commit date of the resume Markdown file with\n\ngit log -n 1 --pretty=format:%cs -- FILENAME\n\nThen I added a step to my rake-based build and publish that fails if there are uncommitted files. I should’ve done that ages ago.\n\nAfter all this work, I’m pretty happy with the result. I learned a bit. Solved some puzzles. Cleaned up some redundancy and poor factoring.\n\nI still have a handful of small things to do that I’ll work on as snacks here and there. A dark mode for CSS, fixing the most-recent-update date on articles using the git commit, some helper refactoring…\n\nWas this yak shaving? Absolutely. Was it fun? Also absolutely.\n"}</script> </head> <body> <nav class=menu> <ul> <li> <a class='' href='/'>Home</a> </li> <li> <span>Posts</span> <ul> <li> <a href='/series/the-cd-test'>The CD Test</a> </li> <li> <a href='/series/obsidian'>How I Obsidian</a> </li> <li> <a href='/posts'>All Posts</a> </li> <li> <a href='/all_tags'>All Tags</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href='/about_me'>About Me</a> </li> </ul> </nav> <main class=''> <article> <section class=headline> <h1> Shaving The Blog Yak </h1> <div class=info> 11 July 2023 &#8212; about a 4 minute read </div> </section> <section class=text> <p>I thought some would be interested in my blog “refresh” story.
