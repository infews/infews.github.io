These meetings are often peer-to-peer or manager-to-person type meetings. Here is how I use Obsidian to take notes during these meetings.\n\nCreate the Person\u0026rsquo;s Note\n\nBefore the first meeting, I make a note with the person\u0026rsquo;s name. Naturally, I use a template for this text.\n\n# {{title}} Background\n\n# Topics\n\n- [ ]\n\n# Action Items\n\n## Me\n\n- [ ]\n\n## {{title}}\n\n- [ ]\n\n\n\nOver time, I fill this template in like this:\n\n\n# Andy Nelson Background\n\n- University of Bedford\n- Likes jazz drumming\n- Partner is Wendy Lam\n\n# Topics\n\n- [x] Next semester\u0026#39;s classes\n- [x] LinkedIn Tutorial\n- [ ] Career goals review\n- [ ] Miles Davis album list\n\n# Action Items\n\n## Me\n\n- [ ] Send goals template\n\n## Andy\n\n- [ ] Write Career Goals\n\n\n\nBackground is for the anything interesting about them. I usually pull most of this from our first meeting, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been known to add to it.\nTopics is for anything I want to make sure to mention at our next meeting. I use checklists for these.\nAction Items gets any tasks we assign to each other during the meeting. Again checklists for these.\n\n\nMeeting Day\n\n\nBefore the Meeting\n\n\nList the meeting in the Calendar section of the today\u0026rsquo;s note, with the time and a link to this file\nCopy the open Topics from this note to today\u0026rsquo;s note as an agenda\n\nDuring the meeting\n\n\nTake notes as needed in today\u0026rsquo;s note\nMark discussed Topics and Action Items complete\n\nAfter the meeting\n\n\nBrain dump any notes that didn\u0026rsquo;t make it to the Daily Note\nMark discussed Topics and Action Items complete in this file, too\nAdd any new Topics, Action Items, other background items, or expand this file\n\n\n\nBetween Meetings\n\nI will add new Topics to the Person\u0026rsquo;s note as they come up. The Linked Mentions tab becomes a great historical list of our 1-1 meetings.\n&quot;}
