      "reference": "Davis has an innate curiosity for technology and new ways to work more effectively. He's not afraid to dive into the guts of the Rails framework nor to try out the \"Rails\" way. With Davis you'll always get the benefit of the doubt. At the same time, he's an assertive communicator when he feels strongly about an idea which he will back up with facts. Davis is of the rare breed of tech people that excel both in development and in talking with the rest of the world. He's a warm human you don't want to miss on your team."

I also enjoyed that while he may have crossed over to management, he still often played a creative and valuable role in architectural/design decisions in the work we were doing. He was always a pleasure to work with, and just as much a pleasure to chat with."

We wanted a Behavior-Driven-Development syntax and a style that would run anywhere JavaScript would run. This framework didn't exist in 2008, so we wrote Jasmine. \n\nWe hope it helps you write great test suites for your JavaScript projects.",
