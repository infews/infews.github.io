A hotel clerk walked over and closed the window, saying a very English nothing.\n\nI talked music with Kim Thayil for a bit. \u0026ldquo;Athens. We played Athens. I love Athens.

And the high school girls crushing just by staring into those eyes (when they were open). \n\nAfter some time a different clerk came and shooed us all out of the lobby.\n\nBut I became a fan. Badmotorfinger and Superunknown are great albums. That voice. His Ave Maria is key to my Christmas playlist.
