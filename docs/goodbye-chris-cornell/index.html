I&rsquo;ve expanded a bit more here. <br/><br/>&mdash;dwf</em></p> <hr> <p>I have a Soundgarden story. </p> <p>July 1990, London. I was helping chaperone some high school students on a canonical &ldquo;American Suburban Kid European Tour.&rdquo;</p> <p>It&rsquo;s after 11pm. Everything is closed, so we headed back from wandering around town to sit and talk in the lobby lounge of our nice, but much older hotel. </p> <p>We&rsquo;ve been there for some time when the window to the street slides open. Four dudes, dressed all in black, and <em>very</em> drunk, crawl through and plotzed down in the chairs next to us.</p> <p>It was Soundgarden. </p> <p>The kids didn&rsquo;t know them. I barely did. A hotel clerk walked over and closed the window, saying a very English nothing.</p> <p>I talked music with Kim Thayil for a bit. &ldquo;Athens. We played Athens. I love Athens. Come see us next time we&rsquo;re in town.&rdquo; Sadly, I never saw them live. In Athens or elsewhere.</p> <p>All I remember of Chris Cornell was the <em>hair</em>. And the high school girls crushing just by staring into those eyes (when they were open). </p> <p>After some time a different clerk came and shooed us all out of the lobby.</p> <p>But I became a fan. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dApSggATER4">Badmotorfinger</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbNIR6dkgNY&amp;list=PLnif9Rfb5AdnVpmUboC3SEZFbcGu80Ea8">Superunknown</a> are great albums. That <em>voice</em>. His <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_T5aLjJ048">Ave Maria</a></em> is key to my Christmas playlist. I miss him even though I&rsquo;ve not liked his more recent songs.</p> <p>Love your friends. Especially when you know they hurt. </p> <p>This is what #adulting is all about.</p> </section> <section class=tags> <hr> This article is tagged with <a href="/tags/personal/">personal</a>, <a href="/tags/rock/">rock</a>. </section> </article> <footer id=post-meta> <a href='/'> <img alt=Avatar class=avatar src='/images/dwf-d2380e10.png'> <div class=details> <div class=dark>Davis W.
