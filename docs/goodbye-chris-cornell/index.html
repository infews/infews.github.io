Four dudes, dressed all in black, and very drunk, crawl through and plotzed down in the chairs next to us.\n\nIt was Soundgarden.\n\nThe kids didn’t know them. I barely did. A hotel clerk walked over and closed the window, saying a very English nothing.\n\nI talked music with Kim Thayil for a bit. “Athens. We played Athens. I love Athens.
