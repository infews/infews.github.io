Enough that I wrote a whole blog series about it! Daily Journaling, general knowledge dumping, and longer-form writing became very natural.\n\nThe job I started after those months of Markdown-ing-more-than-ever-before was remote-first. I was ready to use my new-ish note taking superpowers in another context.\n\nI set up my home office with two screens. I had a 27” monitor full of browser tabs where I did a bunch of Zooming, Looming, and a little coding. And I  had my employer’s laptop with Obsidian maximized so I could take notes as I did all the work. Things started well.\n\nBut a few months into the job, Obsidian and I started having problems. Smooth writing became clunky. What happened?\n\nIt turns out that in a job on a team of other people, collaborative writing is a thing. Duh.\n\nI started any document in Obsidian as always, but when I was ready to get comments or work with others on a shared doc, I moved text over to Google Docs, or later when our team started using it more, to Notion. I needed comments and co-writing, so this made sense.\n\nI learned to delete an Obsidian draft and move it to Notion sooner. I even got better at starting a doc in Notion, preferring to work, write, and think more in the open. But there was still a case where my Obsidian patterns weren’t working: 1-1’s.\n\n1-1 Notes as a Collaborative Document\n\nAs part of my Obsidian series, I wrote about how I tracked 1-1’s. I was pretty happy with how this worked. I kept action items. I linked individual notes into the Daily Journal. It really worked for me most of the time.\n\nHowever, it turns out that 1-1’s are an opportunity for collaboration. Duh, again. The whole point of 1-1 meetings, especially between a manager and a report, is to work through issues, career plans, and meta concerns together.\n\nAn Obsidian vault is not easily a place for “together.”\n\nA Notion of a Solution\n\nI spent a few weeks iterating using Notion for 1-1’s with the other people involved (one at a time). Notion turned out to be fantastic place to experiment with meeting these needs:\n\n\n  Keeping all of my 1-1’s well organized, making it easy to find the next meeting with a person\n  Allow for different meeting templates per person\n  Easy to create a new regular 1-1; my staff changed occasionally, so adding/removing meetings was useful\n  Keeping track of action items the two people were creating and managing in each meeting\n  Keeping the 1-1 notes and action items just for the two people to collaborate\n\n\nI got to a pretty robust solution. Enough that I’ve productized it!\n\nSo if you are someone who:\n\n\n  Uses Notion as your knowledge base\n  Has several regular 1-1 meetings with others in the same Notion instance\n  Have had challenges keeping the notes and action items from these meetings organized\n  Like, or are intrigued by, the idea of 1-1 content being the result of collaborative editing\n\n\nThen please have a look at my 1-1 Tracker (purchase link at Gumroad). And if you like what you see, you can buy it. And if it works well for you, you can rate it.\n\nI hope this helps you. Five Stars. Will take notes again.\n","@context":"https://schema.org"}
