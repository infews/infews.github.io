I bought them in late 2007. They don&rsquo;t make my BART commute quiet, but they make it tolerable enough that I can listen to music and podcasts.</p> <p>Within the first year the wire started to fray a little. I walked into the Bose store in San Francisco and without blinking they gave me a new cable. Very cool.</p> <p>Another couple of years later and my sweaty, bald head had caused the ear cups and cushioned underside of the head band to wear out. I ordered new ear cups ($35 + shipping) from their website and made a mental note to call tech support about replacing the headband when I had a chance.</p> <p>Yesterday two things happened. First, the new ear cups arrived. And then I noticed the cable fraying again in the same spot - the insulation is pulling away from the jack. So now time to call and ask what should I do. I want to order the cable and the headband.</p> <p>Tyler has the rep who got my call. The cable was $15 and easy to replace. But the headband piece was not replaceable.</p> <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve already spent the $35 for the cups. I can certainly send you a new cable, which is $15 plus shipping. But we&rsquo;re certainly sorry that you&rsquo;ve had these issues with our product - they really should last longer than the few years you&rsquo;ve had them.&rdquo;</p> <p>I replied that the electronics are fine. But my glands are just outside Bose&rsquo;s tolerances.</p> <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what we can do - for $89, plus tax and shipping, and $5 to ship your old headphones back to us, I can send you our newest equivalent model. We just released it in the last year or so and they&rsquo;re lots better anyway.&rdquo;</p> <p>Really?</p> <p>&ldquo;Really.&rdquo;</p> <p>Do I need to ship them right away? I&rsquo;d like to use them on a business trip next week.</p> <p>&ldquo;No problem. Print the mailing label when you get it in your email - it expires in a week. But the label is good for 90 days. If we don&rsquo;t receive the old set by then, we&rsquo;ll cancel the whole thing. So drop it in the mail when you get back. You&rsquo;re all set. I&rsquo;ll transfer you to our RMA department to send back the ear cups you&rsquo;ve already received. No problem.&rdquo;</p> <p>Damn. </p> <p>I didn&rsquo;t get the second rep&rsquo;s name, but he finished the transaction before I could tell him the whole story.</p> <p>I&rsquo;m going to give Bose the benefit of the doubt that they&rsquo;ll refurb what they can and dispose of the parts they can&rsquo;t. </p> <p>Meanwhile? Super Happy Customer.</p> </section> <section class=tags> <hr> This article is tagged with <a href="/tags/personal/">personal</a>. </section> </article> <footer id=post-meta> <a href='/'> <img alt=Avatar class=avatar src='/images/dwf-d2380e10.png'> <div class=details> <div class=dark>Davis W.
