We see cooking as a life skill and family activity. Being at home full time means we have a little bit more time to cook things well. Excellent!\n\nWe mix in some local favorite restaurants  - after all, we want them to be open post-Covid - but there are problems.\n\nMeal planning is still meal planning. It&rsquo;s a bit of a chore. And it&rsquo;s very easy for someone to complain about repetition, or general lack of variety. What are we to do??\n\nWelcome to How we plan home meals: A software story.\n\nProblems to Solve\n\n\nWhat are we meals are eating this week? \nWhere should we take out from tonight?\nWhat recipes/restaurants do we like? And not like?\nHow can we reduce repetition of meals/restaurants? (We like variety!)\nHow can we minimize time spent menu planning or choosing a restaurant?\n\n\nIteration 1: Spreadsheet\n\nDuh.\n\nIn April I started a spreadsheet with one night per row, recording the date, the recipe, a link to the recipe, and if we liked it. If we brought in from a restaurant, we recorded the restaurant and a link to their menu.\n\nThis was just simple columns. I did some conditional formatting for restaurants vs. home-cooked. But nothing more than this.\n\nWhen it was time to plan food for the week, I‚Äôd look over the sheet and pick 4 or 5 meals, prioritizing time since last cooked. I‚Äôd add 1 or 2 new recipes each week (from various sources online). \n\nSimilar to recipes, when we decided we wanted to eat out, we‚Äôd look at the top of the sheet and look for restaurants we‚Äôd not visited in a while.\n\nThis solved most of these problems, but the planning time could have been better.\n\nProblems to Solve\n\n\nWe were guessing on age since last cooked or last visited. This was not calculated.\nWe were not counting the # of times cooked/visited.\nScrolling up and down spreadsheet rows make it hard to see history.\nWe discovered we would like to rate recipes and restaurants - we wanted to be able to choose not just based on most-recently-eaten\n\n\nIteration 2: AirTable\n\nPeople had been suggesting AirTable for a while - the ‚ÄúNEVER use a spreadsheet to solve a software problem‚Äù crowd. üôÑ\n\nI definitely have built my share of spreadsheets that slowly acrete functions, and SQL-esque queries, and yes, even JavaScript. And I also hate myself. And the [sunk-cost fallacy][sunk]. \n\nSpreadsheets are great. Until they aren&rsquo;t. Which meant for iteration 2, I was going to try AirTable.\n\nHere‚Äôs a rough sketch of the implementation. I tweaked it regularly to refine, but here‚Äôs where we are today.\n\n3 Tables\n\n\nRestaurants: Name, Rating (1-3 stars), Notes, Count of times linked to Meal, Roll-up to get most-recent-visit\nRecipes: Name, Rating (1-3 stars), Web Link, Notes, Count of times linked to Meal, Roll-up to get most-recent-visit\nMeals: Date, link to Recipe (can be multiple), Link to Restaurant (can be multiple)\n\n\nA Meal is something we ate on a specific date - really just a join, but AirTable calls them &ldquo;links&rdquo;. Each day can have multiple meals and/or restaurants.\n\nAirTable has Views, which are sort of like database views. But they are also the visual UI for working with a given table.\n\nMeals has a Calendar view. This is amazingly cool for planning. Meals has a web form for recording what/where we ate when, complete with calendar widget. Restaurants &amp; Recipes each has a web form for a new record.\n\nRestaurants &amp; Recipes each has a ‚ÄúChoice View‚Äù that sorts first by least-recent-meal (ascending &ldquo;roll-up&rdquo; by date), then by rating (descending star count).\n\nAll views hide any extra fields that don&rsquo;t help with the interaction at hand.\n\nRestaurants vs. Recipes\n\nWe wanted to be able to tell when a meal was home-cooked or a restaurant visit. The idea was to be able to scan and see how much we were eating out.\n\nSo the &ldquo;name&rdquo; field on Restaurants is now a formula that prepends üç± to every restaurant name. It‚Äôs now very easy to scan the calendar. Unicode FTW!\n\nMultiple Meals in a Night\n\nOne night we couldn‚Äôt decide on a pizzeria. It was getting knock-down, drag out. So we ordered from both. Another night the kids wanted to make a Taco Bell run. So my wife and I decided to cook something we knew they hated. \n\nAirTable allows for multiple links to the same date. Meals now allow multiple-links records to Restaurants &amp; Recipes. This gave us the bonus of being able to start tracking multiple side dishes on cooking nights.\n\nüåÆTACO TUESDAY\n\nWe decided to embrace Taco Tuesday! Every Tuesday we have Taco Night, which means wanting to track recipes that are taco-friendly. \n\nWe added a Taco? yes/no &ldquo;choice&rdquo; field to recipes. And we added a Taco-specific view for when we wanted to pick this week&rsquo;s taco proteins. And since we&rsquo;d learned about Unicode support, Taco recipe names are always prepended with üåÆ, based on the field.\n\nA Restaurant Closed?!\n\nOops. COVID-19 claimed a business. We added a ‚ÄúClosed/Avoid‚Äù selection field that allows us to filter the closed places out of the Choice view. And we can use this if we have a lousy experience at a restaurant.\n\nSumming Up\n\nPlanning is now a simple pass over the Choice Views, looking at what we like but have not done recently. Pick 4-5, iterate. Option anxiety reduced. It&rsquo;s also easy to answer, &ldquo;DIDN&rsquo;T WE JUST HAVE THAT?&rdquo; \n\nWhat did I learn? A spreadsheet is a great place to start with any new app that is data-related. There&rsquo;s a threshold you cross where project&rsquo;s complexity begs for multiple tabs, conditional logic, and gasp queries. When you see that threshold, taking a look at Airtable, or maybe the newly announced Google Tables, is a good investment.\n"}
