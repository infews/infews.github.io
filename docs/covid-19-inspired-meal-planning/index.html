We see cooking as a life skill and family activity. Being at home full time means we have a little bit more time to cook things well. Excellent!</p> <p>We mix in some local favorite restaurants - after all, we want them to be open post-Covid - but there are problems.</p> <p>Meal planning is still meal planning. It&rsquo;s a bit of a chore. And it&rsquo;s very easy for someone to complain about repetition, or general lack of variety. What are we to do??</p> <p>Welcome to <em>How we plan home meals: A software story.</em></p> <h2>Problems to Solve</h2> <ul> <li>What are we meals are eating this week? </li> <li>Where should we take out from tonight?</li> <li>What recipes/restaurants do we like? And not like?</li> <li>How can we reduce repetition of meals/restaurants? (We like variety!)</li> <li>How can we minimize time spent menu planning or choosing a restaurant?</li> </ul> <h2>Iteration 1: Spreadsheet</h2> <p>Duh.</p> <p>In April I started a spreadsheet with one night per row, recording the date, the recipe, a link to the recipe, and if we liked it. If we brought in from a restaurant, we recorded the restaurant and a link to their menu.</p> <p>This was just simple columns. I did some conditional formatting for restaurants vs. home-cooked. But nothing more than this.</p> <p>When it was time to plan food for the week, I‚Äôd look over the sheet and pick 4 or 5 meals, prioritizing time since last cooked. I‚Äôd add 1 or 2 new recipes each week (from various sources online). </p> <p>Similar to recipes, when we decided we wanted to eat out, we‚Äôd look at the top of the sheet and look for restaurants we‚Äôd not visited in a while.</p> <p>This solved most of these problems, but the planning time could have been better.</p> <h2>Problems to Solve</h2> <ul> <li>We were guessing on age since last cooked or last visited. This was not calculated.</li> <li>We were not counting the # of times cooked/visited.</li> <li>Scrolling up and down spreadsheet rows make it hard to see history.</li> <li>We discovered we would like to rate recipes and restaurants - we wanted to be able to choose not just based on most-recently-eaten<br></li> </ul> <h2>Iteration 2: AirTable</h2> <p>People had been suggesting AirTable for a while - the ‚ÄúNEVER use a spreadsheet to solve a software problem‚Äù crowd. üôÑ</p> <p>I definitely have built my share of spreadsheets that slowly acrete functions, and SQL-esque queries, and yes, even JavaScript. And I also hate myself. And the [sunk-cost fallacy][sunk]. </p> <p>Spreadsheets are great. Until they aren&rsquo;t. Which meant for iteration 2, I was going to try AirTable.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs a rough sketch of the implementation. I tweaked it regularly to refine, but here‚Äôs where we are today.</p> <p><em>3 Tables</em></p> <ul> <li>Restaurants: Name, Rating (1-3 stars), Notes, Count of times linked to Meal, Roll-up to get most-recent-visit</li> <li>Recipes: Name, Rating (1-3 stars), Web Link, Notes, Count of times linked to Meal, Roll-up to get most-recent-visit</li> <li>Meals: Date, link to Recipe (can be multiple), Link to Restaurant (can be multiple)</li> </ul> <p>A Meal is something we ate on a specific date - really just a join, but AirTable calls them &ldquo;links&rdquo;. Each day can have multiple meals and/or restaurants.</p> <p>AirTable has <em>Views</em>, which are sort of like database views. But they are also the visual UI for working with a given table.</p> <p>Meals has a Calendar view. This is amazingly cool for planning. Meals has a web form for recording what/where we ate when, complete with calendar widget. Restaurants &amp; Recipes each has a web form for a new record.</p> <p>Restaurants &amp; Recipes each has a ‚ÄúChoice View‚Äù that sorts first by least-recent-meal (ascending &ldquo;roll-up&rdquo; by date), then by rating (descending star count).</p> <p>All views hide any extra fields that don&rsquo;t help with the interaction at hand.</p> <h2>Restaurants vs. Recipes</h2> <p>We wanted to be able to tell when a meal was home-cooked or a restaurant visit. The idea was to be able to scan and see how much we were eating out.</p> <p>So the &ldquo;name&rdquo; field on Restaurants is now a formula that prepends üç± to every restaurant name. It‚Äôs now very easy to scan the calendar. Unicode FTW!</p> <h2>Multiple Meals in a Night</h2> <p>One night we couldn‚Äôt decide on a pizzeria. It was getting knock-down, drag out. So we ordered from both. Another night the kids wanted to make a Taco Bell run. So my wife and I decided to cook something we knew they hated. </p> <p>AirTable allows for multiple links to the same date. Meals now allow multiple-links records to Restaurants &amp; Recipes. This gave us the bonus of being able to start tracking multiple side dishes on cooking nights.</p> <h2>üåÆTACO TUESDAY</h2> <p>We decided to embrace Taco Tuesday! Every Tuesday we have Taco Night, which means wanting to track recipes that are taco-friendly. </p> <p>We added a Taco? yes/no &ldquo;choice&rdquo; field to recipes. And we added a Taco-specific view for when we wanted to pick this week&rsquo;s taco proteins. And since we&rsquo;d learned about Unicode support, Taco recipe names are always prepended with üåÆ, based on the field.</p> <h2>A Restaurant Closed?!</h2> <p>Oops. COVID-19 claimed a business. We added a ‚ÄúClosed/Avoid‚Äù selection field that allows us to filter the closed places out of the Choice view. And we can use this if we have a lousy experience at a restaurant.</p> <h2>Summing Up</h2> <p>Planning is now a simple pass over the Choice Views, looking at what we like but have not done recently. Pick 4-5, iterate. Option anxiety reduced. It&rsquo;s also easy to answer, &ldquo;DIDN&rsquo;T WE JUST HAVE THAT?&rdquo; </p> <p>What did I learn? A spreadsheet is a great place to start with any new app that is data-related. There&rsquo;s a threshold you cross where project&rsquo;s complexity begs for multiple tabs, conditional logic, and <em>gasp</em> queries. When you see that threshold, taking a look at <a href="https://www.airtable.com">Airtable</a>, or maybe the newly announced <a href="https://tables.area120.google.com/u/0/home">Google Tables</a>, is a good investment.</p> </section> <section class=tags> <hr> This article is tagged with <a href="/tags/personal/">personal</a>. </section> </article> <footer id=post-meta> <a href='/'> <img alt=Avatar class=avatar src='/images/dwf-d2380e10.png'> <div class=details> <div class=dark>Davis W.
