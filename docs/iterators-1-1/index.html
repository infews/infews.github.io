This series’ contents will be things that I would bring up during the Interestings section of our Standup.\n\nLast, I’ve been looking for a term to use for those of us in the Software Products domain who believe in short feedback loops and improving our practices based on evidence. At Pivotal this started with Extreme Programming, and we added Lean Startup, then Balanced Team. But Pivotal is now part of (a wonderful and challenging) history. And these principles and practices are not exclusive to Pivotal (or its customers, clients, or follow-on entiries).\n\nHow might we refer to ourselves, then?\n\nI propose Iterators.\n\nLet’s see if it sticks.\n\nWith that aside, here are my Interestings for Iterators from the past week:\n\nEssays \u0026amp; Posts\n\n\n  Jason Fraser wrote My Job Hunt Strategy about re-thinking his job search using the principles from Richard Rumelt’s Good Strategy/Bad Strategy.

The Apple Silicon transition has rendered some of these tools useless.

I’ve already used this twice this week!\n\nSoftware Development\n\nYet Another CSS Reset \u0026amp; Starter\n\nThere are so very many of these out there. I’m a big fan of Holiday.css. Our fam at Initial Capacity have an HTML/CSS reset project called CSS Starter. It’s not just a great set of CSS defaults, it also has links to key CSS education and a set of patterns on how to grow your CSS sustainably and maintainably over time.\n\nMy favorite SOLID talk\n\nWhen complex software problems come up, I almost always refer folks to the talk SOLID in the Wild from SpringOne Platform 2017. Pivots David, Mike, and Zoe knock out of the park with a real-world example utilizing SOLID principles to make software adapt. It’s very much in the spirit of Kent Beck’s “make the hard change easy, then make the easy change.” I shared this again this week and it saved someone about a week’s worth of work on a refactor.\n\nFeedback\n\nThanks for reading! And thanks to Nat Bennett for the inspiration. Let me know what you think about this (see my about page).\n\n","@context":"https://schema.org"}
